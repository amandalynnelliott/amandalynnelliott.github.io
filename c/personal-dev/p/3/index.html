No tears in the writer, no tears in the reader. No surprise in the writer, no surprise in the reader.

<p>I am thrilled with the feedback from <a href="https://amandalynnelliott.github.io/blog/2018/02/mental-illness/">my last post</a>—a tear-jerker for any who attempts reading it. It’s a story that took me two years to write… not that I was actively writing it the whole time. I desperately wanted to share my story sooner. I wanted to send it to newspapers, accompanied with my own rude political-cartoon style illustrations mocking the mental healthcare system, but I couldn’t do it. I was too angry.</p>

<p>I couldn’t let myself share my story until I let myself empathize with mental healthcare practitioners—the people I called and left countless unanswered voicemails for help—desperate cries drowned in a sea of others. I had to stop wanting to tear them down and instead see things from their perspective: the overwhelm and frustration that comes from needing to solve urgent problems with the wrong set of tools. You do your best to cover gashing wounds with band-aids, but the line of wailing wounded is going out the door.</p>

<p>I couldn’t let myself write about my experiences with family mental illness until I let myself empathize with mass killing shooters. It is a topic that you think I would be at the forefront of discussing—but until then—I could do nothing but look away.</p>

<p>I couldn’t let myself write my story until I let myself feel all of the pain again. My story has encouraged others to write about their experiences, and I am thrilled for this: we need all the perspectives we can get. But I warn you, this is not easy. The following outlines my writing process, along with common pitfalls that experience has taught me to avoid.</p>

			<p>This is going to be an uncomfortable read for you. Is there a topic that stirs more discomfort than mental illness?</p>

<p>This is going to be a challenging read for you. Is there a field where our lack of understanding translates into the real premature cost of human life, of loved ones, of children, in violently horrific ways, more so than mental illness?</p>

<p>And finally, if you are brave enough to keep reading, this is going to be an emotionally heart-wrenching read for you. We are plagued by mass shootings to the point of numbness, and yet, they keep happening. Is there a topic that makes us feel more powerless than mental illness?</p>

<p>If you can stomach this read, even if you are the only person in the world who can, then the pain I have sifted through to bring you these blood-stained words will not have been in vain. My body shakes in-between sobs as I try to get this message to you. Just you. I couldn’t write this for everyone. I couldn’t make this easy. Nothing about this is easy.</p>

<hr />

<p>The most recent shooting took place in Florida, the state I call home, where I grew up. Palm trees and beaches line the memories of my mom needing to go to the hospital yet again in handcuffs, the experiences of which were not discussed afterwards. <em>“What was mommy sick with?”</em> I am 8 years old and confused. My dad teaches me a new word. “Bipolar.”</p>

<p>Though you may learn a new word, that doesn’t mean that you can say it whenever you want, not even when you need to. Some words are like curse words; any relief you get in yelling them loudly is not worth the risk.</p>

<p><i>F**k!</i></p>

<p>The Florida sun beats down on the car to accent the embarrassment that has flushed my cheeks in a K-Mart parking lot. My mom used to work here, but not since she quit weeks ago. Inside she made a scene in front of her old coworkers as I stood aside with my brother, Matthew. He’s frustratingly too young to understand, and our matching red hair makes us stand out at a time where I’d give anything for invisibility. A former coworker puts his arm around my mom and asks with genuine concern, <em>“Are you okay?”</em> I want to run away.</p>

<p>Minutes later we are in the car and my mom is calling the police yet again. The wait in between a 911 call and the cops arriving to file yet another report that is not true, but that they pretend to take seriously for my mom’s sake, stresses me out. I can’t take it anymore. The police report captures my loud arguing with my mom through the cellphone and ends poignantly: “Daughter hung up on me.” I was twelve.</p>

<p>My illustration output and rendering skills have exploded these last few months; the above being the most recent piece I did. In this post I retrospectively share my work and resources I’ve been devouring on the quest to becoming a better visual communicator everyday.</p>

<p>For those interested in following the journey, every little sketch at a time, you can find me regularly posting on Instagram: <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/amandalynnelliott/">@amandalynnelliott</a></strong>.</p>

<p><em>I am now also accepting commissions. Everything from simple sketches to elaborate complex scenes full of color. If you’re interested, message me <strong><a href="http://amandalynnelliott.com/contact/">here</a>.</strong></em></p>

<p>A big breakthrough I’ve had is embracing color and backgrounds. The above comic pages were heavily inspired by two things:</p>

			<p>I went to a psychic a while ago. Simply guided by curiosity, I didn’t have any specific concerns, but I left with a bad taste in my mouth.</p>

<p>She didn’t say anything explicitly bad, but I walked in expecting a discussion and reflection on life, while what I got were some shallow predictions about general improvements to my life that did not impress me.</p>

<p><img src="https://amandalynnelliott.github.io/assets/img/2017/10/1smoky.jpg" alt="Smoky view in Oregon" /></p>

<p>We have a tendency to view the future as static, fixed, and mostly removed from our control. There’s a tendency to view reality with the cold detachment of a scientific researcher: as if everything can be reduced to the goofy meaningless randomness of colliding atoms that is, again, outside of the control of us mere mortals.</p>

<p>This is such a powerless world-view to have. It makes us wrought with worry and anxiety; as if we are wandering through a thick fog, and anything we stumble upon, be it a million dollars, or a deadly fall off a cliff, would be a total accident.</p>

<p>Luckily, this powerless worldview is entirely optional.</p>

			<p>Over two months ago I packed my little car to the brim with my belongings, and roadtripped with a beloved 3,000 miles, catching many a landmark and animal crossing in between.</p>

<p><img src="https://amandalynnelliott.github.io/assets/img/2017/10/9TaosP.jpg" alt="Taos, New Mexico" /></p>

<p>It was my first roadtrip to the West coast, jam-packed with activities like hiking, horseback riding in a national park, visiting sacred sites, and the like. An exhilarating, albeit exhausting trip (I may have broke down sobbing multiple times, but more on that later) that I will no doubt be dripping with inspiration from for the rest of my life.</p>

<p><img src="https://amandalynnelliott.github.io/assets/img/2017/10/21horses.jpg" alt="horseback riding in the Grand Tetons" /></p>

<p><img src="https://amandalynnelliott.github.io/assets/img/2017/10/20horses.jpg" alt="horseback riding in the Grand Tetons" /></p>

<p>I was looking forward to the end of the exhaustion. The schedule and budget was tight, so most nights were spent sleeping in the car. I hardly remember driving through the whole state of Colorado, fatigue combined with my anxiety about cliff driving<span style="color:red;">*</span> has made the memories fuzzy.</p>
