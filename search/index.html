            "author": "Amanda Lynn Elliott",
            "category": "",
            "content": "Finding my way back to art after deciding not to do art as a career has been interesting. Even if trying to do art full-time depresses me, I still have an inherent need to create. I feel much better when I regularly take the time to express myself visually.If I could say it in words there would be no reason to paint.— Edward HopperAfter completing undergrad in Florida, I had the task of moving to upstate New York for grad school. This entailed going through the many art pieces, sketchbooks, and journals that I had made throughout the years. This process elicited emotions ranging from confusion (so much of what I wrote/drew was nonsensical) and disgust (or borderline disturbing) to inspiring. It’s a strange feeling to inspire yourself from the past.Focusing on the pieces that uplifted me instead of making me cringe, I have collected them onto an Art page and will describe my artistic journey here.Editorial Illustration and EducationAfter high school, I became inspired by editorial illustrators like Victo Ngai and Emiliano Ponzi. I fell in love with editorial illustration as a craft: art that can be eye-catching, but also a glimpse into the themes of the article that the illustrator was commissioned to advertise for. I loved the way that they combined symbols in unexpected ways.Around this time, there was a heat wave in the UK that was leading to deaths, because the buildings were not equipped with air conditioning and generally not designed for such high temperatures. This event had the potential illustration elements of heat and buildings, which could be combined in a novel way: Big Ben melting. In a world of increasing temperatures, the reliability of our infrastructure is failing, as if it is becoming lava beneath our feet.Most of my art pieces at this time focused around education. These pieces were inspired by my frustration with the lack of self-awareness I had at the time and blaming the lack of autonomy provided to students by the public school system. I felt that the emphasis on standardized testing was a hinderance to self-discovery of students and the creativity of teachers’ lesson plans. It was a mundane process of memorize, regurgitate, and repeat.This was the time period when I made this fun piece as well, which suggests diverging into a creative and whimsical journey.DreamsWhen I was 14 years old, I started keeping a dream journal. If you decide to keep a dream journal, you have to commit to writing your dreams in the first moments when you open your eyes. Dreams are time-sensitive. The second you wake up, they start slipping away. In the haze inbetween waking-and-sleeping, your handwriting or phone-typing dexterity may be terrible, but making the effort to record them can be valuable.What I learned by studying the work of editorial illustrators was how to combine elements and symbols in unexpected ways. We are naturally better at this in our dreams. We easily make unexpected connections in our dreams, which is why hearing somebody else describe their dream sounds scattered, even if it makes perfect sense to them.After recording a dream (and snoozing for a while longer), the record you keep can become inspiration for later drawings.Dreams are a playground where your subconscious mind enacts scenarios. It allows you to face the things you are afraid to (nightmares) or achieve the things you desire. Or if you engage in some playful visualization while falling asleep, your dreams can become wildly untethered from your walking reality. You can end up dreaming that you are not yourself, but other people, in other ages.It can be enlightening to analyze the dreams that are especially emotionally intense. The questions I sometimes ask myself are:  How did I feel during the dream? What in my waking life might be making me feel like that?  What are the main elements in the dream? Characters, animals, monsters, or the landscape itself? How do these elements make me feel? Do they represent anything from my waking life?Creative ProcessRecently, I have gotten into painting, and have developed a creative process that I find rewarding.Before changing careers, my creative process would have been “Wake up. Make something beautiful and interesting. Sleep. Repeat.” The only problem was that it wasn’t inspired action. The outcome when I force an art piece, even if it is technically good, is something that people don’t resonate with, and that makes even me sad to look at. Why force ourselves to do anything? Forcing yourself to make art is like an oxymoron.If you ever go to art fairs, you may notice that some artist’s booths have difficulty attacting people, while others are overflowing with people buying art pieces. The difference is not typically skill, either, but the artist’s vibe. Some artists feel desperate, “Please look at my art. Please buy something. Please stop making me feel like a failure,” while others are uplifting, “Look at what I have made. I hope it uplifts and inspires you.”. This difference is profound. Speaking from experience, it took a lot of failed pieces for me to realize that creating for the sake of getting something out of it, such as validation, is a lost cause.When you embark to express yourself creatively, make sure it is from not a place of lack or neediness, but a positive desire to share a part of yourself.When walking around Mt. Hope Cemetery in Rochester, NY, I kept seeing statues of urns that were half-covered with cloth. Apparently, this is a popular symbol that was used for statues in the 1800s, used to symbolize the deceased passing through the veil between life and death.Lately my creative process has the following steps:1. ExploreIt is nice to regularly get exposed to different kinds of creative media, be it sci-fi novels, movies, plays, museums, video games, or nature itself. When I do these activities, I regularly take pictures to later use as reference images for art pieces. Occasionally scrolling through websites like Pinterest can also provide inspiration.2. Create SpaceIt is difficult to create if you feel crowded or overwhelmed by clutter. For me, this step means cleaning my desk. It is important to free up the space needed in order to create something new. This space can be physical, but also mental by meditating or sitting quietly with calming music.3. Invoke what you want to createDefine what you desire. What feeling or concept do you want to express? How would it feel to have accomplished sharing this with others?This part is like sending an invitation in the mail, and then waiting for the RSVP.4. WaitOnce you have defined what you desire to create, you can now take a step back. From anywhere to a few seconds, or longer time periods, like days or weeks, during which your mind will be working on your idea in the background. At some point you will then get struck with inspiration to create it.It is like when you are speaking to somebody and they lose their train of thought. Inevitably, the second they give up trying to think of the thought and start taking about something else, it comes back to them. Stepping away allows you to detach from the outcome, and gives time for serendipitous events to occur that may enrich your work.5. Ride the wave of inspirationWhen the impulse to create the desired idea strikes, it’s important to act on it. I find that if I delay and try to come back to create it much later, I usually can’t summon the same level of inspiration that I had before. It feels like surfing. You see a wave come that you want to ride, and if you miss it, you need to wait for the next wave rather than chase after the one you missed. We are constantly growing and changing everyday. The concepts that you find the most compelling today may be different than tomorrow, and that’s okay. Whenever I miss the wave, I simply go back to Step 3.6. Limit the optionsWhen riding the wave it’s important to prevent overwhelm, frustration, or in general negative emotions that can derail the process. To do this, I tend to think about separating technique from expression. If there is a new medium that I want to try out, I usually work out the kinks with that by doing some studies. That way when I want to create something that has more emotion to it, I feel more confident. I become less preoccupied with the left-side of my brain, making and analyzing mistakes and correcting them, instead allowing the right-side of my brain to utilize the technique as easily as riding a bike. The medium them becomes an extension of yourself that you don’t have to think about how to use.Achieving a flow state is a balancing act between boredom and anxiety. If you are bored with the media or techniques that you usually use, it could be a sign to try to mix it up. But a complete overhaul can be overwhelming.Either way, I like to keep the process simple. When I started digital painting in high school, I installed hundreds of specialized Photoshop brushes which led to analysis paralysis. Now I use the simplier software called Krita and limit myself to just two paintbrushes. I maintain that same philosophy when I paint with goauche. You can accomplish a lot with a limited toolset. If a tool feels like it’s weighing you down, let it go.You can come up with different limitations, such as only using two colors, or limiting a sketch to the small real-estate provided by a post-it note.7. Feel into itArt is a visual illusion that is only convincing if you believe it while making it. What feeling are you trying to trasmit? Follow that feeling to the end.Once you have established a desire to express a certain feeling/idea/concept, and that wave of inspiration comes, there is a relief that follows finishing that work. One of my favorite movie scenes is of music composer Robert Frobisher from Cloud Atlas. He is down on his luck, running out of money and starving, but he obsessively perseveres to complete his magnum opus, the Cloud Atlas Sextet.The end rushes towards me. Unable to eat, or sleep. Like Ewing, the mortal coil has become a noose. Would rather become music.— Robert Frobisher, Cloud Atlas “It’s done,” he says, drawing the bold double bar line to complete his composition.Frobisher is exhausted and relieved, but also changed. The act of creating is a transformative process, leaving you different than when you started. It is this regenerative process that I love about viewing and making art.It has taken many trials and errors to find a rewarding creative process that is uplifting for myself, and for those who I show my art to. I hope that my perspective inspires you to find your unique way of embarking on an artistic journey of your own. To see my other art pieces, you can vist my Art page.",

            "content": "It’s been a wild journey since I wrote about my experience of deciding to switch from art to a physics career, and since recapping on my first semester of undergrad in 2020. Undergrad was very busy. It felt like I had just started to get into the swing of things, but then we were hit with the Coronavirus pandemic, and my university joined the vast majority in the country to switch to completely remote learning for a semester, then to hybrid, and then back to in-person.Once I decided that physics was the path for me, the implication of that meant getting a PhD. The process of applying and getting accepted into a graduate physics program was demanding, but rewarding.During the pandemic, I took advantage of the remote learning to take an electrical engineering internship. I worked on projects for the Department of Defense, and then got a summer internship in Colorado to work on a physics research project for CERN. Later, during senior year, I did a plasma simulation project to investigate the mysterious weather phenomenon, ball lightning.It was a very productive four years. After graduating, I moved from Florida to upstate New York for graduate school at Univeristy of Rochester. Currently being on winter break in-between semesters feels like the perfect time to recap on my undergrad research projects here.Department of Defense ProjectsSophmore year, I did a rewarding year-long electrical engineering internship at Mainstream Engineering. Working there allowed me to use electronics to do research for the Department of Defense while collaborating with engineers from a variety of fields, such as electrical, mechanical, and chemical.I worked on two projects while I was there. Since these projects are ITAR restricted, I can’t describe them in detail, but can provide overviews.The first project was funded by the Air Force. The goal of this project is to create a device that monitors a constant speed drive on A-10 aircrafts. The developed device reads a voltage pulse from a variable reluctance sensor and logs data for each flight.Source: The War ZoneThe hardware and software that I worked on was tested successfully by the Air Force, in following with the testing plan that I developed.One of my favorite parts of this project was reverse engineering a variable reluctance sensor, which included using a scanning electron microscope to identify unknown metals using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and running tests on my prototypes. Building and testing this prototypes was also fun, and involved 3D printing, winding solenoids, and sizing various magnets.The second project I worked on was a novel liquid nitrogen generation system. The system takes surrounding air through an air compressor, and through a series of devices (cryocooler, vapor compression system, etc.), generates liquid nitrogen. For this project, I programmed a touchscreen logic controller for operating the devices via relays, analog signals, and serial communications. The system was monitored by routinely reading a variety of sensors for temperature, pressure, and mass flow. I also programmed data transmission from the controller to a computer for analyzing how the system operates over long periods of time in order improve its efficiency.It was a wonderful experience learning how to collaborate on projects, solder, troubleshoot, program hardware, and write documentation.Space Scientists and Particle PhysicistsThen summer of junior year, I was accepted at a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at University of Colorado, Boulder. This meant packing my bags to live in Boulder for 10 weeks.The Boulder campus is beautiful. From my dorm, my commute to the lab I worked in consisted of a 10 minute bike ride along a scenic trail along a spring.My summer research at UC Boulder was supported by the National Science Foundation. It was the result of an interesting collaboration. Space scientists in Boulder and particle physicists in Switzerland started working together when researchers at the European Council for Nuclear Research (CERN) reached out to the Institute for Modeling Plasma, Atmospheres, and Cosmic Dust (IMPACT) to test a theory. They suspected that the Large Hadron Collider was experiencing shutdowns due to electrostatic dust lofting. The synchrotron radiation generated when accelerated proton bunches travel through the collider could charge the dust inside it. The electric field generated between these protons and the grounded chamber walls could generate a force to pull these charged dust grains from the walls. This project involved running experiments in vacuum chambers and developing a script to extract data from recorded high-speed footage of these experiments.The experiment setup shown below consisted of a high-speed camera positioned looking into a vacuum chamber. Inside the vacuum chamber was a grounded plate where dust would be deposited. About a centimeter above this is a metallic mesh that could have a potential difference of up to 3 kiloVolts between it and the grounded plate. Above the dust setup was a tungsten filament, that when a sufficient current was passed through it and heating voltage was across it, would send a beam of electrons down to the dust. We were interested in studying these two types of electrostatic dust lofting: (1) lofting due to charging via this electron beam, and (2) lofting due to high voltage when the beam was turned off and up to 3 kV was placed across the metallic mesh.Setting up the experiment involved learning how to work with vacuum chambers, and applying some of the skills I learned from a week-long machine shop training that UC Boulder provided. During the program, I learned how to work metal by sawing, drilling, tapping, and also how to use the lathe and mill.We also ran some plasma diagnostics on the chamber using an emissive probe (pictured below) and a Langmuir probe.Alongside the data collection of setting up the experiment and varying our parameters of interest, I also developed a particle tracking script to process the resulting high-speed footage. The goal of this script was to detect lofted particles and calculate their upward velocity and acceleration. From this the electric charge on the dust grain could be calculated. By comparing the change of brightness in-between consecutive video frames, the script was able to detect movement. One of my first test results from the script is below.Surprisingly, with the introduction of a tunable script parameter, it could detect multiple lofted particles at the same time, while also ignoring background noise. Unfortunately, it was still sensitive to brightness differences between videos, and so each video had to be processed individually rather than running them in batches.I also developed a way to calculate the size of lofted particles using what’s called a flood fill algorithm. If you have ever used the paintbucket tool on drawing software like Paint MS, then you have used a flood fill algorithm before. When you click a pixel with the paintbucket tool, it takes all the surrounding region that has that same color and changes it to a new color. I used and modified this algorithm to select for a range of brightness values instead of color to identify the lofted dust particle and calculate its diameter (usually 10-50 micrometers). A result of this is below, with the result of the flood fill colored yellow.One of the differences between our two types of electrostatic dust lofting was the type of trajectory the dust grain traveled in. For the high voltage lofting, a strong vertical electric field was applied which caused the dust to travel vertically upward. However, for lofting due to charging, the charge build-up between dust grains would repel eachother, causing parabolic trajectories. For this type of lofting, I further developed the script to calculate the lofting angle.These particle tracking scripts are available on GitHub.Our results were promising to indicate that the Large Hadron Collider was experiencing shutdowns due to electrostatic dust lofting. The goal of the project was then to characterize the paramaters that facilitate or inhibit dust lofting, with the long-term goal of dust mitigation at the collider. Throughout the project, I had the invaluable guidance from my advisors in Boulder, along with the insight provided by four CERN collaborators. It was an unsuspecting collaboration between space scientists and particle physicists.UC Boulder 2022 summer REU program group photo.At the culmination of my contribution to this research, I presented at Florida Tech’s Northrop Grumman Senior Showcase 2023 and won the awards for Best in Physics and Space Sciences, and Best in Science. We also presented a poster at the International Particle Accelerator Conference 2023 in Venice, Italy.Ball Lightning and Plasma PhysicsDuring my senior year, I decided to indulge one of my more fringe research interests.The realization that led to me switching my career from art to physics is that I am happiest when I focus on solving puzzles. The most interesting puzzle that I am working on is one that I have experienced firsthand. What I am about to describe is strange, but I ask that you have an open mind. The things that we consider strange are just things that are yet to be scientifically explained.Source: H. Boerner. Ball Lightning: A Popular Guide to a Longstanding Mystery in Atmospheric Electricity. Springer, 2019.One night when I was twelve, I was trying to fall asleep, but I noticed light that kept filling my room from my window. It was almost like cars were passing by, but the street I lived on was not a busy one, and so I found it odd.I looked out the window, and saw over the woods in the lot across the street, an orb of white light moving horizontally in the sky. My eyes widened, and I thought, “What is that?” Just then it descended from the sky and came towards me. It was an orb of white light, the size of a soccer ball. It hovered outside my bedroom window a few feet off the ground. It moved horizontally. It would go down the street, outside of my line of sight, and then return. For about an hour it moved in a way that defied any explanation, even going between and around the tree branches of the oak tree in the front yard. It was accompanied by a buzzing or humming noise that made my head feel strange. I tried to drown this out by putting earphones in and listening to music. I spent half of this time hiding under the covers, trying to pretend that it wasn’t there.I went to school the next day as if nothing had happened, telling myself that, “I was either visited by aliens, or I am crazy.”I didn’t tell anybody about the experience until junior year of high school. I confided in my friend, and he asked me, “How do you know that it wasn’t a dream?” I said that it felt so real. I could vividly remember the type of MP3 player that I was using to drown out the humming, the one that I would later accidentally break due to water damage when I would forget it in my pocket during a field trip to a lagoon. I told him how I even remembered the song that I was playing over and over again, which was “Everlong” by Foo Fighters.“Foo Fighters,” he said. “That’s interesting.”“Why is that,” I responded.Apparently, Foo Fighters were the name given by World War II pilots to describe the strange orbs of lights that they would see while flying. “Foo,” being French for fire. They called these objects either fireballs or fire fighters.It wasn’t until high school that I discovered the name for the strange thing I witnessed: a rare weather phenomenon called ball lightning, so named because it tends to be observed during thunderstorms and near lightning strikes. Afterward, I was too scared to share the ordeal with anyone for years for fear of sounding crazy. I was surprised and relieved to learn that thousands of eyewitnesses had reported the same properties I had observed. This event has been a guiding force for my curiosity.Engraving of the ball lightningcaused death of Russian physicist GeorgWilhelm Richmann in 1753 [Boerner,2019]My ball lightning experience has inspired and challenged me. It gives me the firsthand knowledge that there are many unsolved mysteries in the world and the conviction to consider unique perspectives when trying to solve them. Whenever I tell this story a wave of apprehension washes over me. Will they believe me, or will they think that I hallucinated? To witness something that should not exist was a challenging experience that changed me. I had two options to process it. Either I could accept that my perception is wrong and that I am crazy or accept that my understanding of reality is wrong. Either way, the discomfort will always be there in the back of my mind until it is resolved. This discomfort is the feeling of an unfinished puzzle.Senior year of undergrad, I decided to explore this strange phenomena. I started research under advisement of a computational mathematician and a plasma physicist that specializes in solar wind.H-C. Wu. Relativistic-Microwave Theory of Ball Lightning. Scientific Reports 6, 28263, 2016.I came across Hui-Chun Wu’s 2016 paper describing a potential theory for the creation of ball lightning at the end of lightning strikes. This theory involved relativistically accelerated electrons at the end of the lightning leader, that could lead to a type of radiation transmission that could ionize the air, forming a kind of stable, standing microwave, trapped by a plasma shell. Supporting the theory that ball lightning objects are hollow on the inside is that the most commonly reported ways that these objects terminate is either (1) violent termination in which the object comes in contact with something sharp, like edge of a table, causing it to explode with a loud burst of energy, or (2) peaceful termination in which it dissipates like a gas. These ways of termination are similar to how everyday soap bubbles tend to either pop or fade away. My goal was to replicate his simulation results and build on top of them.The first thing I did was set up a plasma simulation software called Smilei, which is an open source particle-in-cell code.One of the simple tutorials that can be run with the code is a laser incident on a column of plasma. This example is used to demonstrate the radiation pressure, or pondermotive force, that can allow for strong electric fields to induce a force on plasma. This effect depends on the number density (number of particles per volume) of the plasma, in relation to a defined critical number density. When the number density is much larger than the critical density, most of the laser energy is reflected by the plasma. When the number density is much less, the laser passes through the plasma as if it was transparent.In-between these extremes, you can get the effect of moving plasma with electromagnetic energy via the laser, like below.In the time that I was working on this project, I was able to replicate the first of Wu’s simulations that involved simulating the type of radiation that could develop at the end of a lightning leader, in the microwave range. I wasn’t able to replicate the second simulation to trap this radiation into a stable circular shape. For my simulation, I was able to get the plasma bubble to form, but it never stabilized.Simulation 2 electric field input.Simulation 2 plasma number density result. There is plasma shell formation, but it is not stable.There are many physical effects that the simulation does not take into account, such as electron collisions with the air which occur at a rate that is much faster than the simulation time scale. It would also be interesting to consider the effect of vertical forces, such as gravity, and the upward convective force, to explain how ball lightning objects appear to hover at a stable distance from the ground.What fascinates me about ball lightning, and what may be the key to understanding them, may lie in their stability. What parameters are key to determining the lifespan of these objects, which is usually observed to be seconds to minutes? Could it be an interplay between internal pressure and plasma shell surface tension, similar to that of everyday soap bubbles?Elegant models and equations provide us with the predictive power to explain a variety of phenomena. The practice of physics requires a balance of approximating reality without oversimplifying it.This is the challenge of developing theories. What physical effects do you include or exclude? The gravitational effect of Pluto certainly exists, but this is of course negligible. Determining what effects are important can only be accomplished through rigorous observation and experimentation, without which, theories can digress from reality. This is the challenge of ball lightning. It is so rare that it is difficult to obtain data directly from ball lightning objects. Until we understand the conditions under which it is created, we cannot predict where it will be created, or artificially create it. Lightning researchers in China were at the right place at the right time, and able to record the spectrum of a ball lightning object in 2014. Other than this, information about these objects are limited to statistical analysis of eyewitness reports, which can be unreliable.Describing the creation, stability, and termination of ball lightning is an outstanding physics problem. My project materials are available here. I presented this research at Florida Tech’s 2023 Northrop Grumman sponsored Senior Showcase and won Best in Mathematics. I also presented a poster for this research at the Florida Undergraduate Research Conference, St. Thomas University, Miami FL (February 17-18, 2023).Research Process and Graduate SchoolThese undergraduate research projects gave me an appreciation for how professional research is done. It is highly collaborative, requires a lot of communication, and it usually takes much longer than you expect to make progress. Research projects are always a work-in-progress, but sharing results is nonetheless encouraged. Almost always, the research digresses in ways that you would never expect. I learned the importance of being flexible with schedules and plans. Encountering unexpected difficulties is not a sign of failure, but comes with the territory of trying to discover new things.One thing I learned from these experiences is that I enjoy collaborating with people from a wide variety of fields. I find that consulting with people with different areas of expertise is enriching, and saves me time by preventing me from falling into traps.Diversity and collaboration are necessary to push the boundaries of knowledge. The intersection of fields seems to be the most interesting source of discoveries because the cross-pollination of ideas is facilitated.During senior year, I also applied to graduate schools. I was so busy that I ended up making most of my conference posters while on plane rides to visit the schools that I was accepted to.A cafe by Utah State UniversityI was thrilled to accept the offer for the physics PhD program at the University of Rochester.Moving to RochesterUniversity of Rochester Rush Rhees LibraryI am excited to be doing my graduate research at the Labratory for Laser Energetics. Given last year’s fusion ignition achieved by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, this is an exciting time to be in laser and plasma physics.One of the concepts that my research will concentrate on is a powerful way to control lasers called a flying focus:Source: Phys.orgFor the first year of my program, I am focusing on coursework and teaching undergraduate physics labs. Though, I am thrilled to continue research this summer.I am grateful for all of the research opportunities that I have had and continue to contribute to. My hope for my graduate studies and career is to continue working with diverse groups of scientifically minded people to further humanity’s understanding of reality by solving its outstanding puzzles.",

            "content": "The last few months have highlighted our need for community. Despite the availability of technology and the ability to easily communicate to whomever and whenever we please, we live in an age of loneliness, where many people feel like they have few people (or even no one) that they can rely on for emotional support.Social distancing has been a catalyst of personal growth for many of us as quarantine forced us into solitude and a period of self-reflection. It was the pause button on the busy-ness of everyday life that was uncomfortable, but needed. Empty grocery store shelves broke the illusion of infinite abundance, and alerted us to the fragility of modern society. After only a month of reduced transportation, city air and waterways got noticeably clearer.These experiences seem to say, “You are not in this alone.”  Your actions are inexorably linked to every other person and living thing on the planet.In the absence of being able to socialize, I realized how much I took it for granted. I realized all the people I wished I had reached out to and met when I had the chance before my university went online. I also remembered the times in which I was in need of help, desperate for community support but felt so alone.During quarantine, I was learning about lightning and came across the term “Corona Discharge.” It is a luminous effect when an electric field causes charged particles to radiate from a conductive surface. If the electric field grows strong enough, or if the conductive object is brought close enough, this charge can arc between objects, as shown here.Source: TSG MIT PhysicsThe lesson from Corona is clear: If you want community, you have to reach out!Similarly, we need to bridge gaps between perspectives.We are facing many challenges that simply cannot be addressed in isolation. To the contrary, many of our problems arose from isolated thinking—from thinking that the isolated actions of one corporation, or of one person—doesn’t affect others. Now we know better.The two main issues I will touch on are Black Lives Matter and the environment.Black Lives MatterThe footage and stories that have been circulating from the BLM movement has been nothing short of a wake up call for me. Police brutality is a problem that simply cannot be ignored anymore. The stories that we hear are likely only a fraction of what has happened, and it highlights the need for serious repercussions and accountability to be put in place that would prevent officers from behaving aggressively without cause, putting people in life-threatening holds, giving confusing commands at gunpoint, and falsifying reports.The article Confessions of a Former Bastard Cop should be required reading. Some eye-opening quotes include:\"In fact, let me tell you about an extremely formative experience: in my police academy class, we had a clique of around six trainees who routinely bullied and harassed other students: intentionally scuffing another trainee’s shoes to get them in trouble during inspection, sexually harassing female trainees, cracking racist jokes, and so on. Every quarter, we were to write anonymous evaluations of our squadmates. I wrote scathing accounts of their behavior, thinking I was helping keep bad apples out of law enforcement and believing I would be protected. Instead, the academy staff read my complaints to them out loud and outed me to them and never punished them, causing me to get harassed for the rest of my academy class. That’s how I learned that even police leadership hates rats. That’s why no one is 'changing things from the inside.' They can’t, the structure won’t allow it.\"\"Understand: Police officers are part of the state monopoly on violence and all police training reinforces this monopoly as a cornerstone of police work, a source of honor and pride. Many cops fantasize about getting to kill someone in the line of duty, egged on by others that have. One of my training officers told me about the time he shot and killed a mentally ill homeless man wielding a big stick. He bragged that he 'slept like a baby' that night. Official training teaches you how to be violent effectively and when you’re legally allowed to deploy that violence, but 'unofficial training' teaches you to desire violence, to expand the breadth of your violence without getting caught, and to erode your own compassion for desperate people so you can justify punitive violence against them.\"- Officer A. Cab, Confessions of a Former Bastard CopThe article points out an important question: Why are cops the first people we call for problems that would be better addressed by social workers? When the use of lethal force is so rarely needed, and when cops predominantly get to the scene after the crime has already been committed, why is the primary tool for people in crisis an armed soldier, whose primary tool is a gun?Why are so many resources being used to fight crime, when preventing crime could be magnitudes of order more effective?Reimagining the Los Angeles city budget by sandusky_hohoho.The challenge that the BLM movement faces is that it has periods where it makes a lot of noise, but then fades away. The movement needs more calls-to-action. Besides protesting and signing petitions, what action steps can be taken? What specific changes can be implemented?This movement is no substitute for strong communities. It can be a source of inspiration, but at a certain point, the baton needs to be passed to local community members, and not dropped. This can come in the form of shared conversations, local events, and the kind of sustained actions that lead to changes in local representation, policies, and culture.When it comes to social concerns, there is a wide discrepancy in commitment: People either devote themselves wholly to a cause, start a nonprofit, and vow to “change the world,” or like most of us, are far too busy with working full-time to take any action at all.Your actions are inexorably linked to every other person and living thing on the planet.Another lesson from Corona is that we can be productive, often from working at home, and by working less hours. A lot of the stress we feel in everyday life is artificial and unnecessary, and we are much more efficient and capable than we give ourselves credit for. In accepting this, we can liberate some of our energy and time from meeting our survival needs for the purpose of building and serving our communities.Actions don’t have to be large in order to make an impact.EnvironmentWhat’s good for the environment and what’s good for the economy are often two different things. How can we make them the same thing?It simply does not pay to be a company that cares about the environment. If anything, companies are rewarded with greater profits for doing exactly the opposite: being negligent of, or directly abusing, shared environmental resources. For many corporations, the name of the game is hiring people to lobby state legislators so that environmental regulation never impedes their profits.Each local area has their own specific environmental concerns, but there are also the global concerns, namely the pollution of the ocean and the carbon emissions in the atmosphere. These are shared concerns that must be addressed, and cannot be addressed with isolated thinking.We live in an incredible age of abundance where you can order a product from anywhere in the world and have it shipped to your doorstep. A global network of farmers gives you the illusion that crops are in season year-round. Almost anything you can imagine can be manufactured to the exact shape that you envision and mass produced using plastic molds. It is an important question: Can we continue this level of production and efficiency and also be sustainable?I am optimistic that the answer is yes, and that modern society is not incompatible with sustainability. However, much would need to change in order for sustainability to be realized.It can be hard to grasp how far removed our modern energy consumption is from the span of human history, but it helps to translate the energy that we regularly use and take for granted into manual labor, or the number of slaves needed to generate that energy.If you convert the amount of energy consumed by a typical individual living in a first world country, the estimate is anywhere from the conservative side of needing 50 slaves to generate the electricity for their residence, to easily over 100 slaves if you include the energy consumed in their transportation, and in growing and transporting the food they eat.Imagine that: Living in modern society, and living a “normal” middle class life, with luxuries like washing machines, personal cars and computers, and not having to grow your own food, is the energy-consumption equivalent to having 50-100 slaves personally working for you.To get an idea for the math behind these estimates:  How much of a slave master am I?  Joules, Watts, KilowatthoursWhen I did the math for myself, doing a conservative estimate of just taking into account my monthly electric bill and commute, the number came to 84 slaves.The conversion of human mechanical power to electrical power is pretty terrible, as demonstrated by Walter Lewin in this MIT physics lecture. You can turn the a crank until you’re red in the face, and you would be lucky to have some toasted bread to show for it. It’s something to think about while you blast your AC in summer.It’s important to note, that the energy efficiency of our most used sources of power—be it burning fossil fuels, nuclear power, and even solar—tends to be pretty terrible and at less that 50%. The other half of potential energy is lost as other means, like heat. Yet, despite these inefficiencies, we continue to use these large amounts of energy to satisfy our standard of modern living to live like kings.All of this energetic abundance is only made possible by the trees and organic life that lived and died millions of years ago. The fossil fuels that we extract from the Earth is, in simple terms, highly concentrated energy in limited supply.We are facing many environmental challenges, and I am flabbergasted that being concerned about the environment is a political stance. People can devote their lives—decades of hard work—to developing a scientific understanding of the environment, while people with no such training can simply deny their findings and life’s work. If you say the problem doesn’t exist, that doesn’t make it go away.There is a growing distrust of experts and science in political arenas that is concerning. Skepticism is important, but because of the internet and how easy it is to research, the Dunning Kruger effect is running rampant. People who read about issues for a few minutes believe that they understand the topic more than people who have been researching it for their whole lives. In this regard, coronavirus may be delivering a dire wake-up call.ConnectionThe Black Lives Matter movement and the environmental challenges we face at first seem like completely separate issues, but they are connected. These issues perpetuate because capable people are inactive and silent. These problems perpetuate because we believe that there is no harm in isolated actions.The message of BLM is that black individuals should be respected and honored; not “accidentally” executed without cause and without even an arrest or trial. When an officer’s negligence results in loss of life, they should face justice.Similarly, we have been mistreating the environment. The Earth has become our slave. We take what we want, abuse, and don’t show compassion or seek to understand how to be a participant in a healthy and diverse ecosystem. When a corporation’s actions result in lasting damage to the environment, they should face justice.Not only must we demand more, but we must do more. We need to hold each other accountable and support each other. This is what it means to be a part of a community.How to Be an Active Community MemberSome of these steps are better taken after the threat of coronavirus has lessened, or done cautiously by wearing a mask and social distancing.  Introduce yourself to your neighbors by bringing them gifts and cards with your contact information on them.  Clean up litter in your neighborhood.  Attend local events, such as City Hall meetings, University public lectures, local art gallery events and plays.  Watch and share documentaries. Or even host a documentary viewing event at your local library or community center. Some good candidates areOur Changing Climate , Rotten, and videos about the Green New Deal.  Read about issues that are important to you. Some books on the environment that I’ve liked are The Third Plate and The Hidden Life of Trees. Also checkout Confessions of a Former Bastard Cop.  Shop locally at small businesses and farmer’s markets.  Donate to important causes, community service and outreach programs.  Support independent journalists.  Find a local nonprofit and volunteer.  Become a role model for an at-risk youth through Big Brothers and Sisters.  Protest. It is your fundamental human right guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution and the First Amendment.  Sign petitions, or even create your own petition.  Post online. Tell your story and share the stories of others.If more people believed that their actions were linked to every other person and living thing on the planet, how would the world change?Still I RiseYou may write me down in historyWith your bitter, twisted lies,You may trod me in the very dirtBut still, like dust, I’ll rise.Does my sassiness upset you?Why are you beset with gloom?’Cause I walk like I’ve got oil wellsPumping in my living room.Just like moons and like suns,With the certainty of tides,Just like hopes springing high,Still I’ll rise.Did you want to see me broken?Bowed head and lowered eyes?Shoulders falling down like teardrops,Weakened by my soulful cries?Does my haughtiness offend you?Don’t you take it awful hard’Cause I laugh like I’ve got gold minesDiggin’ in my own backyard.You may shoot me with your words,You may cut me with your eyes,You may kill me with your hatefulness,But still, like air, I’ll rise.Does my sexiness upset you?Does it come as a surpriseThat I dance like I’ve got diamondsAt the meeting of my thighs?Out of the huts of history’s shameI riseUp from a past that’s rooted in painI riseI’m a black ocean, leaping and wide,Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.Leaving behind nights of terror and fearI riseInto a daybreak that’s wondrously clearI riseBringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,I am the dream and the hope of the slave.I riseI riseI rise.- Maya Angelou (1928-2014)",

However, when there are visualizations available, I find them incredible. The following are resources that I’ve been using as I start my math education journey.3Blue1Brown3Blue1Brown’s YouTube channel is full of unique and incredible math visualizations. When I first started watching his videos, I thought that he painstakingly animated all of his content using standard animation software… but I was pleasantly surprised.

He scripts each visualization to output to a video file.His video on divergence and curl is an superb testament to the power of visualization.\tGeoGebraAnother source of visual math insight is GeoGebra which allows you to visualize various proofs, matrix transformations, or higher math concepts with ease.

            "content": "I’ve just concluded my first semester at technical university pursuing math and physics undergraduate degrees after a palm reader suggested this as a potentially more fulfilling career path for me than art.When I graduated from high school and community college six years ago, I was certain that I would never want to return to academics. However, since starting school, I am pleasantly surprised to discover that I fit in perfectly! I’ve never felt more at ease and confident in my career direction before.Are you as surprised as I am?I enjoy my classes, and often seek additional learning resources outside of class. It feels like a long period of frustration and confusion is finally at a close.Even still, this was the hardest semester I’ve ever had. The following are two projects that I worked on.Red Tide Research ProjectMuch of my work this semester went to my technical writing class. The bulk of the class involved group work, organizing 1-3 group meetings a week, all awhile researching an approved topic. Our topic was red tide.Red tide is a kind of microorganism that proliferates so rapidly that it turns seawaters red. It is a kind of harmful algae bloom that produces dangerous toxins that can affect respiratory and nervous systems.                Red tide. Source: Florida Daily    When red tide is in bloom, the toxins it creates become airborne via sea spray. If inhaled, these toxins cause respiratory problems. If fish that have been contaminated with red tide are accidentally ingested, these toxins can cause Paralytic Shellfish Posioning, and can be fatal.Of course, humans aren’t the only animals affected by red tide. It can cause massive fish kills, also kill marine mammals and birds, and can devastate any ecosystem in its wake.                Brevard County Fish Kill 2012. Source: Susan Frazier    When red tide affects an area, beaches are closed. It disrupts an area’s economy by negatively affecting tourism,  fishing, and recreational industries. Red tide is a complex problem that negatively impacts public health, the ecosystem, and local economies.My goal with this project as team leader was to create a report that would be useful: something that could even be referenced by people working on addressing red tide. With this goal motivating us, we conducted three interviews.First we interviewed university biology professor, Jonathan Shenker. During which, we learned that red tide is a naturally occuring phemonenon. The earliest documented sightings date back to the 1500s when Native Americans warned Spanish explores not to eat fish caught in discolored waters…While red tide is naturally occuring, human activities make it worse. What causes red tide to proliferate out of control is nutrient pollution caused by fertilizer runoff, sewage system leakages, and general poor waste disposal practices. When red tide comes to coastal waters, the presence of these excess nutrients provide the necessary food for the algae to proliferate out of control.Is there any ecological benefit to red tide? Like a forest fire that in the short-term is destructive, but overall is good for the longevity of the forest?Shenker didn’t think so. Red tide appears to have neither a population-controlling benefit, nor any other direct benefit to an affected ecosystem.As an observation, most harmful microorganisms tend to be abiotic — meaning that they thrive in oxygen-depleted conditions. Harmful algae blooms like red tide thrive in waters deprived of oxygen. Similarly, the kinds of organisms that live in soil and produce toxins also thrive in oygen-deprived conditions: in this case, in compacted soil that lacks air flow. It is these kind of abiotic soil conditions that can lead to agricultural produce recalls. For more on microbiology, I recommend Dr. Elaine Ingham's lectures.RecommendationsIn refraining from too drastic recommendations, like BAN ALL FERTILIZERS, we concluded our research project with the opinion that Brevard County is actually doing a good job in working to address red tide.I was impressed with the level of research conducted by various programs funded by Brevard County’s half-cent sales tax. The sales tax was enacted by popular vote in 2016, the funds from which go to improving our local bodies of water by means of dredging (a process to remove muck), oyster restoration, and updating old sewage systems. From the first year alone, the sales tax raised almost $94 million dollars.To gain an understanding of these solutions, we did two more interviews.First we interviewed Walker Dawson, chief engineer of the one of these programs, the Save Our Indian River Lagoon Project. In talking with him, we learned that from decades of poor waste disposal practices and run off, 64,000 acres of Brevard’s Indian River Lagoon sea floor is smothered by muck.                Muck. Source: Florida Tech Ocean Engineering Students Dredging Project     Is there a thing as too many nutrients?Yes. Caused by excess nutrient buildup, muck effectively smothers the seafloor, causing seagrass dieoffs and preventing sand-dwelling organisms from thriving. When muck is pulled up to the surface, it smells like rotten eggs. Even if you had gills, would you want to call that home…?The presence of muck has decimated filter feeder organism populations that could filter excess nutrients out of the water naturally. Clams, for instance, are excellent filter filters that live in sand. However, in Brevard, clam populations plummeted in the 90s and since then have never fully recovered.                Nothing can live in muck. Source: Walker Dawson of the Save Our Indian River Lagoon Project    For our last interview, we interviewed Katy Leban of the Restore Our Shores program, who works to restore populations of filter feeding oysters.In optimal lab conditions, a single oyster can filter through 50 gallons of water daily. Restore Our Shores has  partnered with local restaurants to donate their used oyster shells. These shells are then used to make oyster cages that become the homes of developing oyster larvae. They also solicit volunteers who live dock-side to hang these oyster cages from their docks and to care for them.                Source: Restore Our Shores' Shuck and Share program.    Our recommendation to address red tide was to continue the two methods that Brevard has already been implementing to positive effect:  Dredging, or the process of using hydraulic pumps to physically removing the muck that is smothering the estuary seafloor.  Oyster restoration so that natural filter feeders may rebound, thus keeping in check the excess nutrients that harmful algae blooms thrive on.From both methods starting to be implemented, people have been reporting improved water clarity in targeted sections of the Indian River Lagoon. For our project, we were impressed with Brevard’s thoroughness in researching red tide and applying these methods that hold promise for rehabilitating the local estuary ecosystem.What you can do to prevent red tide by reducing nutrient pollution:  Don’t use fertilizer, or know your county’s fertilizer ordinances. For example, in Brevard County there is a ban on Phosophorous fertilizers year-round because the land is already abundant in Phosphorus, while during the rainy summer months, there is a partial ban on Nitrogen fertilizers. Better yet, instead of using fertilizer, study and apply microbiology methods which can be more effective in the long-term.  Don’t wash your car at home, which can lead to chemical runoff. Instead, go to a car wash, which has to follow thorough waste disposal practices.  Volunteer at restoration programs or start an oyster garden if you live dock-side.LessonsWhile I don’t think we reached our initial goal of making something that other people would use, I would say having this goal motivated us during the project. We learned a lot more than we would have if we were simply trying to complete an assignment. While it would take much longer than a single semester, on the order of years, to research and synthesize new findings that would contribute to this complex topic, our report (at 65 pages) is still a good introduction to red tide.You can view the table of contents here:Contact me if you would like the full report.This project has given me an appreciation for how long it takes to contribute research to a field. It’s with good reason that it takes years to do a PhD program. I also got experience and had fun leading the team, delegating tasks, and exploring the topic together.My leadership style seemed to be effective. I felt like my job as team leader was to ensure that each team member was happy with the delegation of work and felt like their concerns were heard. My style was a combination of applying pressure by holding people accountable to the tasks that they said they would do, while also not taking things too seriously by having fun with the work.It seems like many teams fall apart because of poorly communicated expectations. When a person fails to meet an expectation, resentments can build, and the longer the issue isn’t discussed the more the relationship festers. This was why during the project I would send 1-3 emails to the team per week, clarifying what each member’s expectations were, and answering any questions. We were the only group in the class that didn’t seem to be suffering from interpersonal conflicts.Also for the class, I designed a logo and icons like we were a bona fide company, and we gave a 20 minute presentation on our work.When you start a project, embark with the goal of contributing something meaningful, and see what happens.Data ScienceThis semester I also started working with a group that provides an outlet for me to learn data science and Python. The specific work is analysis of data generated to simulate that of data collected from particle collison events at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider.Largely, the work is over my head, but I’ve been learning a lot about machine learning techniques like neural networks, regression, and interpolation. I will likely write about these topics in the future once I gain more experience.Particle physics is one of many fields where we have more data than we know what to do with. Machine learning is just a fancy term for outsourcing the task of data analysis to the computer (or computer clusters if you’re really getting fancy!) These programs can process large datasets faster than any human could.More to come. In the meantime, I leave you with this snippet of a programming project I did for fun: Conway’s Game of Life. The complex structures it produces are fascinating considering that it is the result of four simple rules and each cell only has two states: alive or dead.

            "content": "Depression compelled me to seek help in the form of a retreat. My art career pursuits were leaving me unfulfilled and unmotivated for life, so I brought my sketchbook deep into a Georgian forest in search of clarity and confidence.In-between encounters with beautiful people, I heard that the hostel manager was offering palm readings and that she was very good. Having had an experience with a psychic before who was very bad, I decided to give her a shot with an open mind.Putting my sketchbook in my bag, I went into the reading, her eyes penetrated into mine while she held my hands, measuring lengths of my fingers, feelings the strength and limberness of various features, all while speaking. It was shocking how she knew me, while I had never met her before. I felt so exposed. Some of her statements were so on point, so personal, and I was so in need of hearing them, that at multiple points I almost burst into tears.While I did not ask her any specific questions, in the middle of the reading, she said I was a creative and artistic person captivated by beauty… but that pursuing an art career would only be a struggle for me. She went on to say that while that was the case, that I had an unconventional mind and actually had a gift for math and physics.When the reading ended, I wrote what she had said into my sketchbook, and that part stuck in my head like something that didn’t sit well.“Ugh. Math and physics… Why?”Years of TryingYears ago on the cusp of adulthood, I had decided to be artist. It felt like the right thing to do. Making art is fun; why not make a career of it?I had tried so many different kinds of creative disciplines:illustrationgraphic designweb designevent planninganimationlandscape designalternative healingpaintingNo matter what I tried, I could never seem to summon the motivation to do any discipline on a consistent basis. Once I figured out the fundamentals of how it worked, I’d move on.It seemed like what drives me was not a desire to express the vision of others. I grew bored of marketing once I understood it, and I couldn’t stand being in the position of having a client expecting design work from me and wanting reiterations.What drives me was not even a desire to express myself artistically. I sat down and painted everyday, but I grew to hate these paintings and had no motivation to finish them.I tried enforcing consistency and routine:  I tried keeping a record of what I would work on every day — a log of progress with future goals to work towards.  I tried habit-forming apps.  I tried the schedule of commiting to just 20 minutes of creativity every day — just long enough to get into the flow state — or short enough to abort and do something else if I just wasn’t feeling it.I was never feeling it.I read many articles on how to become a professional artist and on how to improve at art. The universal advice in these articles was terrible, always a focus on: “Whatever you do, don’t give up.”Giving up from a place of defeatism, is one thing, but sometimes letting go is exactly what is needed.“Draw everyday” was also terrible advice. Drawing everyday will make you better at drawing, this is true. But it might also make you hate drawing and yourself.People who like drawing naturally draw almost everyday, and so don’t need that advice. They are probably already professional artists.People who don’t draw everyday either want to draw everyday but fail to prioritize it, or they don’t want to draw everyday but don’t want to admit it. Most advice targets the first case. The belief here is that the only thing separating a person from a goal is sheer force of will and discipline.The difference here is subtle but very important. Successful professional artists are happy making art everday. Unsuccessful artists are unhappy making art everyday, but hope that one day, when they eventually are rewarded success, they will be happy.If you are unhappy being an unsuccessful artist, then gaining success won’t make you happy. If anything, success brings obligation and more pressure, things that you will be crushed under if you don’t actually enjoy the work.Looking back at the drawings I made from the retreat, I can feel how they came less from a place of enthusiasm and more from a place of obligation. Feeling like I needed to get better. My sketchbook had become my anchor tethering me to guilt when I would inevitably fail to put any sketches in it. It wasn’t my natural disposition to draw all the time, and no amount of discipline was going to change that.Looking back, the connecting thread that does motivate me, seems to be solving problems, researching, and exploring mysteries. It was this that motivated to try all of these disciplines in the first place, and it’s the very same drive that kept me from being able to commit to any single one of them once I understood them.    Source: Rob Colvin on RedBubbleFinding Fun in RoadblocksSuccess isn’t the promise of being happy in the future, but feeling joy in your actions on a daily ongoing basis.Much of working life involves overcoming roadblocks. It’s only a question of which roadbloacks do you enjoy helping others overcome? People will pay you for helping them overcome roadblocks, and they’ll pay you in proportion to how good you are at it. The more you enjoy it, the better you’ll get at it, the more money you’ll make.Most people focus on the positives when considering career paths: the fun parts. But I find it much more useful to consider the negatives of a potential career, and ask yourself if you could find joy in that.It sounds fun to make games, but could you enjoy spending the bulk of your time debugging code that you've already written?It sounds fun to grow food for your family and town, but could you enjoy spending the bulk of your time doing physical labor, dealing with problems like pests, diseases, and drought?It sounds fun to create recipes for restaurants, but could you enjoy delegating solutions to problems in a high-stress environment, like the kitchen running out of an essential ingredient in the middle of a rush?All work has positives and negatives. Rather than solely focusing on what work you enjoy, focus on what work you would enjoy for the very reasons that many other people wouldn’t enjoy it.What roadblocks do you enjoy overcoming? What kinds of stress give you a sense of fulfillment?Purposeful ProcessDespite deciding for art to be my purpose, and trying to adapt myself to it in every way I could think of, at the core of my being, it was wrong for me.I’m not making the same mistake of declaring a new purpose, because life is not knowing the end. Purpose is not a definition, but a process.You have no purpose alone. Purpose is the process of relating to others and giving to them.Every person comes here with gifts to be shared, but I’m beginning to think that each person’s gifts may be as unique as their DNA. You will find rhythm in a unique blend of actions and relationships that will refine you over time, as long as you remain open, adaptable, and attuned to your heart.Without definition, without the need for self-validation, what do you want to give?Math and BeautyWhen the psychic suggested that I may have a gift for math, my heart sunk.Math had always come easy to be growing up, and I exceeded grade-levels, being taught algebra in third grade, but my desire to learn math came to an adrupt halt when I was entered in a math competition at the end of elementary school. My team and I couldn’t solve any of the problems nearly fast enough, and so we ended up just waiting for it to be over. It was humiliating.I didn’t want to learn math because I grew to see it as most high schoolers do: boring, irrelevant, and needlessly difficult. I wanted to do what others would admire. I wanted to make beautiful things, and math did not seem beautiful at all.Now, the more I explore, the more I see how math does contain beauty… it’s harder to see, but beautiful in it’s symmetry and complexity. Math doesn’t reveal herself to anyone all at once, but only parts of her, and slowly, over time, to those who court her.    You can follow my Pinterest boards here.ReliefI was so locked into tunnel-vision stubbornness that I didn’t want to consider the psychic’s suggestion, but once I did, once I let go of art, I felt liberated. I still draw, but not nearly enough to constitute a full-time job, and I accept that.Within a month after the retreat, I applied and was accepted to a university, majoring in physics. It was the same university where I applied and was accepted to six years ago before I changed my mind to forgo college to explore vague ideas of making art and starting a business.I didn’t go to college because I didn’t want to make the mistake of choosing a career that wouldn’t make me happy, but in isolating myself to art, that’s exactly what I was doing: living in present unhappiness for the promise of happiness in the future.At first I felt silly, embarrassed for having made the mistake of not attending the first time… but six years has made me a very different person. I’m not going to university in order to prove something, or to get it over with, but to the contrary: I could not be more excited for the experience, community, and resources.Tuition being over $40,000 for the year, I somehow managed to qualify for enough scholarships and financial aid that I didn’t need to take out any loans. This change in direction has brought tremendous relief, and everything seems to be falling into place.In these waning days of summer before I start classes next month, I fill my free time with math, of all things. I put aside my sketchbook in exchange for a notebook and calculator. When people see me doing math, they ask me if it’s homework. It’s like people assume that I couldn’t possibly doing math for fun. ;-)It is surprising to me still, everyday, that I find math problems so fun. How was that psychic able to see something about myself that I couldn’t?    Source: Byron EggenschwilerBecoming NaturePurpose is not a definition, but a feeling, a general direction. It’s important to remain open and unencumbered by your own preconceived notions about who you are and what you’re here to do. I started this year sure of the fact that I was not a mathematically-minded person, that I was not cut out for science fields, and that I didn’t like academia.In letting go, all these preconceived notions flew out the window.It feels like… becoming nature. The forces of nature around us consistently operate from a place of wisdom despite our ignorance of how these forces scientifically work. I can’t communicate how this works, and many Eastern mystics have attested that such truths are beyond words. But what I can say is that life is better lived in the flow of this force than against it. You always have the choice in action between what is natural and what is unnatural.The distinction of what is natural for me, doesn’t feel like a choice. The only choice is to accept what is and flow with that truth… or not — and accept the consequences either way. It is a choice made in every present moment.Fear wants you to have a clearly defined destination. Fear wants reassurances, rationalized explanations, proof.Maybe the only constant is change. Maybe your purpose can’t stand to be caged anymore than you would. Maybe the very narrowing rationalizations that serve to placate our fears simultaneously dampens a spirit that is fearless in it’s expansion.Becoming nature feels like getting out of my own way.You want to find your purpose? Stop looking for it. Let it introduce itself to you, let it change you, and let it both confirm and disprove everything you’ve ever thought about yourself.I’m not trying anymore, and yet making more progress than ever. I’m letting myself be as I am, while accepting that I don’t know what that is. It’s so difficult to accept how easy it is. In moments of blissful clarity, I remember completeness. It’s when I forget that I feel fearful and separate.What do you do when you feel complete? I’m sure whatever it is, it’s a force of nature to behold.",

            "content": "  People are born stars, naturally giving off light and warmth. Through negative circumstances, some collapse in on themselves and become black holes.    Source: GizmodoWith the recent first ever photograph of a black hole, this is an exciting time to be alive. We are making progress unraveling the mysteries of the creative and destructive forces that make up our universe, and also, our minds.The story of good versus evil is as old as mankind itself, but instead of “good” versus “bad,” I find it useful to view these as creative and destructive forces. Creation is what we consider good: love, light, the spark that produces things of value, birthing new life and art. Destructive forces we see as the evil antagonist to this: that which ends life, monsters that lurk in the shadows waiting to devour us, our fear of the unknown, psychopaths, and those that harm themselves or others.For the last year, I’ve had my personal struggles with these destructive forces. I have not been able to create much, but not for lack of trying. I have been riddled with mental traps put in place from years of schooled conditioning… but now I am finally free.I share my journey with hopes that others may escape the black holes of their darker natures so that they can feed their light of creation.The Light is WithinI open with a poem:Anxiety\"Am I doing the right things?\"The question claws from within your skull,Digging for it's answer.It's a question best left to others,to the experts:popes,professors,prophets,politicians,and the popular,Who are all more than willingto put your scarred brain at easefor a priceyou can't afford.But what of the work that goes unnoticed?Countless hours of work done for no applause,done alone,in faiththat the allusive answeris within reachYou venture on a ledge,the breath of the living abyss whirling up and around,quickly pulling back,beckoning you to the dark unknown.Will you jump?Is the most meaningful workdone in this dark solitude,when you can't even seethe page?You make out stars,pinpricks in the skythat guide your way.The gold stars you were so proud to earn as a kid,cheap beacons shining your way,directing your pathaway from rocky shores.These symbols of safetyare now neither sticky nor shiny,with glue pleeing,They fall.You hear them hit the ground one at a time with a loud thud,THUD!THUD!THUD!You turn around,a lost child,graspingfor the figure who will illuminate,who will ignite once moreyour fading sky…You wait and wait.Aching heart, you wait.The day having exhausted itself,you are alone for the cold night.No one comes to your aid,and you make campamid your aging pile of unfulfilled expectations.In the name of survival,you build a fireand pick each sticker up, one at a time,Throwing it inWatching them blazeKeeping you warmand for once you knowThis is right.    Source: Lemat WorksGrowing up, I was the “smart” kid. The one with straight-A’s, in gifted programs, and by all accounts, going places. These labels became a part of my identity, and I became so dependent on authority approval and guidance, that it led to my professional manipulation.The school routine hijacked my intrinstic motivations to do work, with extrinsic ones. Rather than doing work because of the fulfillment it gave me, I pursued work based on the opinions of others. Easy enough when you have one authority to please, a single teacher, but upon entering the real world, who is your master?Rather than love guiding my way, fear led me to dark places. Fear is a compelling reason to get schoolwork done, but let’s be honest, schoolwork isn’t meaningful work. The real world doesn’t value memorization and reguritation of information, the skill that I had largely been trained to do. Once I entered the real world,the only things I produced that people valued were creative works that only poured out of me once I released the resistance and fear getting in my way.Talking to YourselfIn the six years since graduating school I have cycled through periods self-hate where I would beat myself up for not being “good enough,” with occasional periods where I finally let go, embrace self-love, and as a result, my creative works would effortlessly flow out of me.But no matter how many positive affirmations I told myself, the sessions of repeating “I am good enough” in the mirror, the destructive force was always in the background, gaining strength, until it would once again knock me down like a tidal wave.I was so sick of these thoughts that I just wanted to kill their source, and perhaps that was why they kept coming back. I remembered the lesson that insanity is doing the same things over and over again but expecting different results, so I tried something else. I stopped trying to kill this destructive voice and instead gave it a name: Brutus.Space Weird GIF from Space GIFsBrutus, who had been the source of so much pain in my adult life, to my surprise, actually had the purpose of protecting me. This is surprising: What possible benefit could come from being so hard on yourself? But all habits, even the destructive ones, have some kind of positive benefit. Otherwise, we wouldn’t do them.I let Brutus express his purpose, and I finally understood. He was born as a way for me cope with my anxiety about my place in the world, my fear of abandonment, and as a way to reinstate my “brilliant kid” status. According to Brutus, while I had been “brilliant” in school, in the real world, I no longer was, and regaining this label was the key to my survival.The only problem? The stress of this would make me so exhausted that my mind would entertain suicidal thoughts as a form of self-relief… because at least when I’m dead I don’t have to struggle to become “brilliant” anymore…It sounds dark and overdramatic, but these are not the thoughts of my present rational self. Brutus, I discovered, was a fractured past self in need of reintegration.Later, I realized how I couldn’t have chosen a better name. In ancient Rome, Brutus was one of the leaders of the rebellion that assasinated Julius Caesar. Brutus, in stabbing his friend in the back, thought that he was doing what was the best for Rome, but those actions would lead to it’s undoing. The government was thrusted into a civil war, and the Roman Republic soon was no more.My own personal Brutus similarly thought that the key to my future survival was in present suffering, but you can’t beat me into the ground and raise me up at the same time. I am relieved to have finally put an end to this civil war within my mind.    Vincenzo Camuccini's depiction of the death of Julius Caesar (1798)    Destruction painted by Thomas Cole (1836)Black Hole QuestionsMy negative thoughts centered around not feeling good enough, having disappointed others, and of being a failure. No amount of combating these thoughts with positive affirmations worked. The problem was not in the answers being positive or negative, but the fact that I was asking these questions in the first place.Questions like:  Am I good enough?  What do others think of me?  Where should my skills and career be at this age? Am I behind?  Is my art, my work, good enough?The problem with these questions is that their answers are irrelevant. Even if there was an authority on these matters (the notion of such a person sounds ridiculous), so what if they thought that you’re not good enough, your art sucks, and you’re way behind and too old to do your work. You have your answers, now what?So what if you aren’t good enough. You exist. There is no governing authority determining your worthiness to have life. What do you want to do?So what if your art isn’t good enough. Do you want to make art anyways?So what if you’re too old. Do you want to get started anyways?The answers to these questions, positive or negative, are irrelevant because these are questions that are black holes that will do nothing but suck your energy and give nothing back.I remember when I was an emo pre-teen, in the throws of angst, I would often ask myself, “What’s the point?” I would ask this to the point of depression. Eventually, I got fed up, and realized that this question amounted to nothing but the desire to self-destruct. It was a black hole that when fed with my attention, would grow in power to the point of threathening my life.Entertaining these kinds of questions are as toxic as drinking bleach. If you value your life, if you value the creative force in the world, then treat yourself as a ball of energy, radiating light. Your thoughts can either feed or dim your light. The people who resort to destructive actions are those who have collapsed in on themselves, but that doesn’t mean they are lost. Protect your light and the light of others.If life gets you down, look inward. Find the spark within yourself and know that everything that you want can only be found within. Enjoy your existence, your free will, and do whatever the hell makes you happy.You are the star guiding your path.",

            "content": "In part one I discuss the personal benefits of faith in overcoming challenges life throws at you.Now in this second and final part, let’s extend that perspective to encompass the world.Faith is Risky BusinessPersons with high levels of personal mastery… cannot afford to choose between reason and intuition, or head or heart, any more than they would choose to work on one leg or see with one eye.― Peter SageLeaders and inventors don’t only focus on what is commonly accepted. Allergic to conformity, visionaries are strange with their habit of constantly challenging our assumptions. Their resulting insights, though beneficial to society, can be detrimental to those whose empires depend on upholding the status quo.The very act of innovating means to make what existed before obsolete.Innovation is only good for business if you’re the one innovating.History has not been kind to most visionaries. The more resistant to change we are as a culture, the more they suffer at our hand. They lie in silent anguish, their works a well-kept secret. They are burned at the stake, exiled, or condemned to drink poision―a justly punishment for “poisioning the minds of youth.”People with faith change things, and change is uncomfortable.Those with faith are regarded as foolish or are met with concern, and why wouldn’t we be? We are standing on ground that doesn’t exist―yet.Dreamers vs LeadersFaith is beyond fantasy.Faith is what allows you to persevere through failure. Without faith, Thomas Edison would have been a person who dreamed and talked about the concept of a lightbulb, maybe even gotten people excited about it, but he never would’ve gone through the trials to make electric light a reality, and we wouldn’t know his name today.Can you imagine going through a thousand failed experiments without faith?When a person’s inner faith surpasses their fear of being ridiculed enough to inspire them to take action, they become a leader.Trying to lead from a place devoid of faith, but full of wishful thinking and blind optimism, is exhausting.Leadership requries a lot of energy, but it’s not accurate to say that this energy is generated purely from within the leader. This energy is given to the leader from those he is in resonance with.The True Nature of InspirationWe are all frequency. You resonate strongly with an action only because there are other people who are matching your giving frequency on the receiving side.Inspiration is a telepathic call-to-action.Have you ever followed a content creator, and then saw that they posted something that was so immediately relevant to you at the time, that was the exact guidance you needed for a specific problem? This happens to me and my friends all of the time.When I follow my inspiration, I resonate more with people. It’s almost like people, consciously are not, are asking for specific things, specific answers or experiences, and that energetic call-to-action then finds the person best able to respond through their work.Inspiration is an indication of cosmically-supported energy transference.Faith. Inspiration. Intuition. These are all the same words for the same thing.vocare (v.) Latin - to answer a call; usually describes life in a religious order but also means to recognize \"a voice.\" This voice is distinct and like no other. It invites you to follow it.The word vocation literally translates to a calling―something you have been called to do.You can call this voice a number of things. Your higher self, Spirit, Source, Collective Consciousness, God, the Universe…Education for InventorsUnfortunately, it’s rare for people to enter adulthood with their connection to their inner voice intact.The circumstances that brought me to calling the suicide hotline was a life lived ignoring that voice in my head. To understand how that happened, we need to go back to the invention of the light bulb.The story of Edison’s brilliant invention is incomplete without talking about what technology his lightbulb made obsolete: the kerosene lamp.Thanks to this new invention, industrial giant John D. Rockefeller was almost put out of business. With time, his ruthlessness brought him back, stronger than ever, but he never forgot the lesson.Rockefeller was a strong supporter and philanthropist for public education―but only for his kind of education.I don't want a nation of thinkers. I want a nation of workers.― J.D. RockefellerThe purpose of the school system Rockefeller helped build and what we still have today, isn’t to educate, but to homogenize. It isn’t to develop uniqueness, but to get everyone to think the same. What better way to accomplish this than to condition children to conform each other?School typically is a pleasant experience for children until third grade. Around that time, school stops being fun, and kids start learning to ruthlessly attack any idea―or other kid―that stands out as different.Classrooms are battlegrounds for young inventors who are condemned to outcasting and remedial classes―too bored to engage, feeling too stupid to do anything meaningful, and labeled a freak.Growing up at this age was a painful experience for me. I believed I was an introvert, but my social isolation was actually a way for me to protect myself against the ridicule and outcasting that would happen whenever I would express my “strange” ideas.I find it hard to imagine bullying remaining such a systemic problem without the conforming and comparison machine we call school nurturing such harmful behavior. Bullying is not natural, but it’s just one of many pain inducing things we do when we learn to ignore our inner voice―our collective voice―which are both one in the same.Is it any wonder why most of the world’s innovators are school dropouts?Time to LeapThere are things in the world that upset me… Our lack of understanding in mental illness and the negative impact we are having on the planet, for starters.And I am supposed to accept these powerless narratives, roll over and wait for the end?I don’t think so.I have faith in the voice in my head leading me to research into alternative perspectives on “mental illness.” Many people believe that they are victims of genetics and circumstance, that diagnoses are life sentences, and that there is no hope outside of a pill bottle. I reject this.I also have faith in a future where we live sustainably with our environment. Many wish to ignore the detrimental impact that carrying on with “business as usual” is having on our blue planet, and to pretend that that the problem doesn’t exist. My faith gives me the courage to look, but instead of accepting what I see, I’m free to imagine and invent new futures.I have made peace with my faith and the risk that expressing it requires. The ground I stand on may not exist yet, but I invite you to join me in building it.You have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition… What you'll discover will be wonderful. What you'll discover is yourself.― Alan AldaNo path is better than the one taken on unwavering faith. The gift is not the destination, but the journey. It’s not what comes to be, but what you are becoming.",

            "content": "We have to continually be jumping off cliffs and developing our wings on the way down.― Kurt VonnegutI’m on a massage table in an healing room surrounded by candles, crystals, raddles and feathers, not sure what to expect. A strange tall hermaphadite statue with a penis and breasts looks down at me, as if questioning me: What are you doing here? Before I can answer, the Shaman enters, asks me to relax, places a crystal on my abdomen, and gets to work.As he waves his hands over me, I’m shocked at the feeling of energy shifting in my body, waves of tingling sensations rise and subside… When he’s done I feel relieved, noticable lighter, as if emotional pain had truly left me…How did I get here―to the point where I am taking a Shaman healing class, exercising enough of an open mind to blow emotional traumas into crystals and have conversations about chakras and energy fields…?The simple answer to that question is faith.FaithMiracles are not contrary to nature, but only contrary to what we know about nature.― Saint AugustineFaith used to be a dirty word to me, a word that meant foolishly believing in the unreal.I considered myself a rational person. I told myself that I must see first, and only then will I believe.Things changed when my family was in crisis. I had no reason to believe that things were going to get better. All of the evidence, the doctors, the accepted facts and statistics, pointed to the contrary: Things, unbearable as they were already, were only going to get worse.Suicidal thoughts richoetting in my head, I couldn’t continue living without faith. The only way I could pick myself up was to believe that things were going to get better, in spite of evidence. There’s nothing rational about my beliefs, but they make me feel better about living.Secular DepressionUsing logic all on its own to disect the disparate events of life can sometimes tell you how things have happened and may also provide that might help you in preventing future disasters. But logic can't show you the underlying causal forces, can't reveal the mystery or the magic, and can't answer the question \"Why?\"― Colette Baron ReidThe word for the belief system that I used to have, as many do in our non-religious secular society, is called logical positivism. It states that no statements have meaning except those backed by impirical evidence. In other words, until you can show me the numbers, the tests, statistics, and pie charts, we have nothing to discuss.The founders of logical positivism wanted a society where religion and philosophy was stripped of any power, and where only Science held ultimate truth, the God of a secular world.For better or for worse, we have this scientifically founded society. The downside of stripping religion and philosophy from our lives―from trying to remove any trace of subjectivity from existence―can be felt in the form of emptiness and depression. Life seems to hold no meaning anymore.Cutting yourself off from meaning makes it harder to cope with the challenges of the world that happen to you “for no reason.”There are many grey areas of our existence that science has yet to answer: What happens to us after we die? Why are we here? What is the meaning of life? …And we are supposed to live in this black void of meaninglessness, rejecting any potential answers, as we wait for Science to deliver us?Not me.For more on logical positivism, I recommend this well spoken lecture by R.C. Sproul: Failures of Scientific Atheism.Harnessing ImaginationThe interesting thing that happened for my life, is that the more I let myself embrace that dirty f-word called faith, the more that I imagined my life getting better, the more it actually did.Imagination is everything. It is the preview of life's coming attractions.― Albert EinsteinFaith requires an exercise in imagination. Taking the “leap of faith” can easily become an act of suicide without seeing the ledge on the other side and believing that you can make the jump.Visualizing your future as a continuation of unpleasant circumstances is to deny your free will to direct your life. Visualizing catastrophes is an even worse use of imagination. Is a captain stranded at sea truly a victim of circumstance if he’s been asleep at the helm?We resist faith because we don’t want to be viewed as irrational, or disappointed if reality falls short of our expectations.It may be safer to accept what is already accepted than it is to venture on any ledge, but don’t expect that lack of action to result in any positive change.ListeningIsn’t it funny how counter-intuitive listening to your intuition actually is?I had to commit to a year of living by the question of “What would somebody who loved themselves do” before I could listen to my inner guidance as second nature.Living according to your inner voice is a surprisingly rational way of working smarter, of working less, but with more results.Any inner conflict within you will drain your energy and make it harder to accomplish anything you set out to do. I can’t rationalize having my intuition at odds with my mind. The only justifications to ignore my intuition comes from fear, which isn’t a fun way to live.Without the Shadow of DoubtDoubt clouds your intentions and dims the light of consciousness. We learn to doubt our inner voice once we are conditioned to prioritize how others perceive us over how we feel.  What would you be doing if you already were “successful?” If you already had all the money and accolades you could ever need?  What would you be doing if you knew that you were never going to be successful―never to attain significant wealth or achievement? What would you do to occupy your humble existence?  In considering your answers to these two questions, which answers overlap? What work would you be doing no matter how others perceived you?The answers you receive to these questions hold the key to your authenticity.Live a Life of EaseI recently applied the above thinking to my own career trajectory and was surprised by the result. I realized that my desire to produce art and to animate has not been nearly as strong as my desire to research and write―specifically into the topics of emotions and consciousness.Working on my visual skills and getting clients has felt like an uphill battle for a while. I only recently realized that I would never be happy as a visual “hired gun”―taking art commissions or animation jobs in order to execute somebody else’s message. I’ve recently accepted that I am first and foremost a writer, the one conveying the message. I need the freedom to research and write about whatever Providence guides me to.It’s taken me a long time to be able to say this, but: I trust the path to unfold before me.We spend so much energy going against who we naturally are, trying to be something we’re not. Life is so much more rewarding when we live like children, simply by letting go and focusing on what comes easy and naturally to us.",

            "content": "We are at odds with our home. We live in disharmony with Planet Earth. Rather than rehashing doomsday statistics, the pollution, ozone, and animal extinction rates, let’s see how simple mindset shifts can empower us to take positive action.This post is about hope.The first step is always the hardest. It is believing in new possibilities where before there were none. It is letting go of the overwhelm and powerlessness you may feel as a single human being on a vast planet in need of help.The first part is accepting that no, you can’t do it all, but that also, your actions matter. Your way of living, of being, of thinking, touches everyone that you come into contact with and spreads. Sustainable change is gradual change, and as you know, this is a post about sustainability.I invite you to make a difference with me. These changes will not be sudden or overwhelming, but to the contrary, are gradual, and might even be fun.ImagineAll innovations live first in the imagination. Once we believe in the new exciting possibility of global sustainable living for all, we now have the fun part of filling in the “How.”Before we can imagine a sustainable planet, first let’s imagine a sustainable home. How would such a home interact with it’s environment? How would it be powered, heated, and eliminate waste? How would its residents get food?Then let’s expand from that to a sustainable neighborhood. A sustainable town. What would such a town, made up of sustainable homes, look like?Now with a sustainable town, let’s expand to a sustainable country. What would visiting a sustainable country be like? How would its citizens live? How would you have to adapt to their ways of living?Suddenly, with the aid of imagination, tackling these challenges before us transitions from an overwhelming to an exciting endeavour. It becomes a catalyst for bringing together local communities. It awakens the pioneer, the problem solver, within all of us.Doing the above exercise gave me the three following mindset shifts.1. Trash Doesn’t ExistWe push our pollution out of sight. Ship it off to other countries, dump it in the ocean, or bury it underground. Out of sight, out of mind.Similarly, what do so many of us do with our emotional problems? Don’t we also try to bury our negative emotions deep within us, with the hope that we’ll never have to deal with them? Out of sight, out of mind…But now the pollution is on our shores, in our food, in our lungs. There is no hiding from yourself. What within you are you refusing to acknowledge?Just as we can’t digest our negative emotions, so too the planet struggles to digest our hidden trash.Just as we are backlogged with unresolved issues, so too is the planet.Trash is a foreign concept to Earth. Trash, as a purely human invention, are objects that are permanent but no longer usable. To nature, there is no such thing as trash, as waste, as permanence. Everything is recycled. Everything is used again and again into eternity. Everything is made a new into something else. Nothing is permanent, and change is the only constant. Death and rebirth is the cycle that keeps on spinning.To regain harmony with the planet, we literally need to “throw away” the concept of trash. ;-)2. Accept ImpermanenceWe are in denial about the impermanence of physical life. We bury our loved ones in thick, impenetrable, cushion-lined boxes. We fear decomposition. We fear the cyclical nature of life that is death and rebirth, and so do our best to build permanent structures, hell, even permanent one-use disposable plastic cups, so we never have to face our mortality. This fear becomes one of the many things we bury inside and try not to think about.When an animal dies, it goes back to the Earth. It becomes the food for the decomposers in the soil, which in turn, gives nutrients to nearby plants. Animals eat those plants. Animals eat those animals. In whatever fashion, whenever they die, they go back to the soil, and the cycle continues onward. Nothing is wasted. All life is constantly changing into different forms of life. Nature is the ultimate recycler.To be alive is to evolve. Resisting change, resisting growth, pushing down your negative emotions, which are your catalysts for change, halts your growth. Doing this causes you to be out of tune with the symphony of life.Letting your emotions flow, learning from them, changing with them, is how you harmonize with yourself, with others, and with the planet.3. ConqueringIf we are to regain harmony with the planet, we must let go of the antiquated “conquer the elements” mindset. We not only live on Earth, we are Earth. We are the elements. The only thing we are conquering is ourselves.You might also find it useful to personify the planet as Mother Earth, or Gaia. It’s easier to violate an inanimate rock than it is to violate your own mother. I admire the cultures that have managed to live in harmony with their environment because of their reverence for nature. The Native Americans, the Aboriginals of Australia, and countless other indigenous cultures that lived for thousands of years in harmony with their homelands. Meanwhile, modern society has only existed for a couple hundred years, and we’re already in trouble.I find it amusing that we look down on ancient indigeous societies as “primative,” when in fact, we could stand to learn a lot from them.We must transmute our negative emotions. We must heal our traumas. This is the process of exaltation, of integration, of recycling the pain that lies in the wastelands of our souls.The beautiful thing is that once we see living in harmony with nature as a possibility, life takes on magical qualities. You see the consciousness in all life. You see how we are all connected.Transmutation was always an act of magic. Couldn’t we all use a little magic in our lives?As above, so belowAs within, so without***In the future I will post more about sustainability as I work towards my long-term goal of growing my own food and building a homestead. But for now, I leave you with these links and a photo from my garden.I’m convinced. This is no sunflower, but a beanstalk!

            "content": "There are two paths before you.Most people don’t choose. They stand still. In never stepping into their power, they become the tools of those that do.In choosing between the two paths before you, in embarking beyond this fork in the road, you become a sovereign being. You stop being only effected and start affecting your environment.The first of these two paths is glittering with gold. It promises to give you everything you can imagine: fame, wealth, success, and a never-ending line of adoration. The price of this path is pretty straight forward: your soul. What? You don’t want it badly enough? Don’t you know that success requires sacrifice?I have a confession to make: I have walked this path of darkness. Driven by a desire for power and the security it promised to provide, I worked for a man who was anything but trustworthy, but who demanded absolute trust from anyone who had the honor of working with him.The process of grooming me for this manipulation took him over a year. He attended my publicly hosted meetups and positioned himself as an intelligent, business-savy mentor—someone willing to provide guidance to me along my uncertain path as an ambitious 19-year-old without direction.After one of my first meetups he attended, he pulled me aside, said that he believed in me, and that he wanted to invest thousands of dollars in helping me start a design business.After a few more conversations, he dropped off the face of the earth. I didn’t hear from him for six months. When he eventually re-surfaced, he asked me, “Did you learn your lesson?”During this grooming process, without evidence of his claims of success, and without even so much as knowing his last name, I found myself becoming more intoxicated with his unpredictable presence. He promised to lead me to all the things I desperately desired—all of those glittery things which would make me finally breathe a sigh of relief and feel good enough.The disappearing acts taught me the “lesson” that I needed to prioritize his guidance, or more accurately, his demands, over all else in my life. The only way he would agree to giving me the honor of his “mentorship” was if I agreed not to tell anyone about it. Not even my parents. Not even my boyfriend. I agreed.I have never felt so alone…I have a confession to make, for I have lied. During the worst six months of my life, a time period that I’ve described previously, I was living a double life. While I was running around at late hours of the night following any commands my manipulative mentor would give me, I lied to my loved ones, saying that I was starting a web design business. Meanwhile, I was transforming into something that I didn’t recognize.He would give me assignments which I would work on during 12+ hour days sitting at my computer desk in my bedroom. Or the assignment would be to drop everything and visit a local business or event in order to recruit individuals for one of his numerous projects. I would do these things without knowing the next steps in his plans, without payment, without question, for six months. I awaited his instructions daily like an addict waits for his drug dealer.I thought he was teaching me business, but what I was actually learning was how to manipulate others. This is my confession. This is my guilt. I would inspire other young adults in the community—get them excited about working on seemingly important projects—and then teach them similar “lessons” on why they must value my time and presence above all else like the limited supply and unpredictable drug it was.The control got to the point where I couldn’t send any email without forwarding it to my manipulative mentor for editing. I could only send an email once it was “approved.” He would coach me before phone calls and tell me the agenda for meetings I would host. He was the invisible puppet master pulling at my strings.I would record the audio from these conversations and report everything back to my manipulative mentor.Interesting how the road to power is built by making people dependent on you.I found myself at a strip club, with my mentor telling me that I need to get more comfortable with alcohol and with the night scene, because it’s where I will be taking my clients and conducting business.I found myself agreeing to his plans for him to “socially engineer” my fame. To stage constructed stories for the press on how I “transformed” the life of a stripper from one of pole-dancing to one of God. Just one of his many ideas on how to manipulate public opinion on my behalf.I found myself creating social media accounts under my name and sending him the usernames and passwords so that his “team”—that I never met—could post and communicate to people and build a following on my behalf.I found myself agreeing to his plans for me to have a book ghost-written for me; a term that means authored by somebody else in secret. People would be so impressed to see that a business book, so profound and practical, was actually written by a teenage girl…Aren’t I wonderful?I think I’m going to be sick.I had no awareness of how horrible this all was as it was happening—that’s the whole point of being manipulated. This man became the most important person in my life, the best thing that ever happened to me, my ticket to success, but no matter how much I bent backwards for him—I could never seem to please him. He was a shadow that flattered me and promised to fill the void within me with everything that I believed was missing. I didn’t need to see who he really was for that transaction to happen, did I?I thought I was losing my mind and had good reason to believe that. He would repeatedly use my own words against me until it got to the point where I would document everything I did or said into my phone, daily. This process he was doing, I know now, is called gaslighting.The strongest symptom of being manipulated is always feeling guilty. This individual is the best thing that has ever happened to you, you prioritize them above all else in your life as they have requested, and yet, they are never happy with you. They can do no wrong, only you can, and boy, do they let you know when you do.The first of the two paths requires giving your power away for the illusion of power. All that glitters is not gold…One day, I desperately needed for him to proof-read a few emails so I could know my plans for the next day. How could I host meetings if I didn’t know what to say? I needed his words to come out of my mouth.I heard my heart beating so loudly and rapidly that it was in my ears. I was shaking. I was scared that he was going to abandon me yet again, this time for good, and I would be left alone in the lerch, exposed as a fraud and a fool. I needed to step away and do anything except compulsively checking my email for his responses.So I went out. I went out to eat with my boyfriend and got a haircut, the whole time with a racing heart, feeling horribly guilty for stepping away from the work and still anxiously checking my email on my phone for any kind of response.I got home. Still no response.The next day, no response.I couldn’t take it. I had messed up again and he had abandoned me, and I would never know why. I was hyperventilating and crying. I had just lost the best thing that had ever happened to me, and now was never going to feel whole. All of the gold before me evaporated like the mirage it always was.In breaking down, I broke the first rule. I told someone. I cried hysterically apologizing to my boyfriend for having lied this whole time. I was convinced that he was going to leave me for this, but to my relief, he was actually relieved. Finally being let in on what had been happening explained my erratic behavior. He told me that I had been manipulated. I thought I was losing my mind.The next morning, a feeling of relief washed over me. I didn’t have to sit at my desk all day long until my legs swelled? I didn’t have to live in anxiety wondering what I would be doing from one minute to the next? I didn’t have to live a lie? I didn’t have to do any of it.This is what the first path looks like. It is incredibly inticing. It promises security, but in walking it, I have never felt more insecure, powerless, or paranoid.Even from the very first meetup that my mentor attended, our earliest conversations, his words caused me to have a vision. I saw these two paths before me, and two different versions of myself. On one side, a version of me in a black blazer, powerful, wealthy, but cold. On the other side, a version of me that was a free, creative, and loving, a hippy-like artist. I knew that I would have to choose.I believed that nobody would love me if I wasn’t successful, continuing to the top as I had been as a top student in school. I chose the first path thinking that it would lead to the most acceptance, not knowing that it actually led to the most isolation. In learning to manipulate others, I started viewing people, not as human beings, but as objects. I would catagorize these objects into one of two categories: useful or not.I have never been so disgusted with myself.This path of darkness I have described for you, is the path of Fear. Walking it means making fear the primary factor in your decision-making process. It is the path of incalculable sacrifice and isolation. In choosing to harness this ultimate form of resistance, fear, it can lead to incredible power. You don’t have to look very far in positions of power in our society to find people who are operating this way.The problem with the path of fear is that it’s unsustainable. It’s not authentic and built on the shaky foundation of lies on top of lies. In not generating energy from within, you become a parasite that needs hosts.My temporary stint as both a manipulatee and a manipulator, left me with a fear of encountering another individual like this ever again. I became a recluse. I renounced my business goals, my voice, and went off the grid.During that time, I healed my relationship with myself, and learned that all of the things I had been desperately wanting to fill the void within me with would have never made me feel whole: only I could do that for myself. Only I could give myself the acceptance that I needed. Only I could empower myself. I learned how to do that.In learning how to heal the conflict within myself, I learned what real power actually is. The second path may not be as alluring. It is humble and naked in its honesty, but it’s all you could ever need. It is Love.Rather than trying to get this infinite power, this endless rejuvenating energy, indirectly through success, fame, and fortune—through feeding off of the approval of others—I learned to tap into it directly.I empathize with my former mentor and manipulators like him. Manipulation is a coping mechanism you learn when you don’t trust others not to hurt you. In not being vulnerable with people, in not being honest about your intentions, you protect yourself. The people you encounter are simply objects that are either compliant to you using them, or not. If not, you discard them.It’s nothing personal.Or so they say.Eventually, I healed enough to reclaim my voice. I started developing this blog. In an event that was no coincidence, almost exactly one year after the manipulation ended, I ran into the man I hoped I would never see again.Seeing him at the food court of a mall, of all places, the aura of fear around him had either gotten stronger, or I had become more sensitive to it. Either way, my knees were shaking. He asked to speak for five minutes. I wanted to run away, but I felt that familar powerlessness again and I agreed to talk.Between smalltalk and pleasantries where he feigned compassion for me in his usual way, he said that he ended up abandoning me the year prior because I kept getting worried about him leaving. He said I had incurred three strikes, and his rule with people is that once that happens, he disappears from them without saying a word. He said that his team was working on my social media accounts at the time, but that I had changed the passwords. In a blatant tactic of intimidation, he said that they could’ve just brute-forced into the accounts anyways…Seeing the confusion on my face, he changed tactics, saying that he wanted us to be friends. He wanted me to know that he had no ill-will towards me and that he hopes to talk more in the future.In not giving him any answers into his questions about my recent whereabouts or activities, I saw his demeanor change. He turned to his associate and started talking to him like I didn’t exist. I had been discarded.What a relief.I left shaking and upset at how a person that opperates like this could exist. When I calmed down, I realized the signifance of the timing of the meeting. I was just about to come out of hiding and start sharing posts publicly again. I was going to share everything, and I needed courage to do that.I am not scared anymore.It has taken a long time to heal from the trauma of being manipulated. The annoying and time consuming habit of recording every detail into my phone every single day stayed with me for almost two years after the manipulation ended.I’m still processing my guilt from my compliance to compromise my integrity so severely. To have a book written for me in my name? To live a lie? Was I really going to go through with it? How could I have been so naive?I’m still processing the guilt for the monster I was when my mother needed me the most. I was a raving workaholic that in-between yelling at her to take her medicine, and taking her to the mental hospital against her will, I was yelling at her to stop interrupting my important work. This is my guilt that every now and again threathens to consume me alive… I just wanted her to be proud of me.It took me a while to be able to go to events and meet people without being paranoid. I eventually started hosting meetups again, but they are private and invite-only. I am never opening myself to routine ambushing ever again. I protect myself, and you should too.The void within me was where self-acceptance should have been. I grew up prioritizing the desires of teachers over my own for my whole life. I have always depended upon authority for my life direction and self-approval. In the absence of that role of authority, my manipulative mentor filled that void foe me, whereas most of my peers filled that void with colleges and universities.The signs of manipulation, of varying degrees, runs rampant in our society. I empathize and wonder in horror at the people whose manipulation lasts longer than six months, but for years on end…In thinking about some of the famous today, I can’t help but wonder how many of them have given up their soul for the honor of a life of illusory significance in the limelight.I am relieved to say that I no longer view people as objects, but as extensions of myself. This means everyone, even the people that I perceive to have hurt me, even the people I have hurt, they are all a part of me, no exceptions. For my healing process, I can see it as no other way.My mentor and I might as well have been looking into a mirror, the same fear of abandonment being reflected back to each other. This fear drives a never-ended web of lies around you, shielding your vulnerabilities, until you’re just as stuck in a form of bondage to others as you want them to be to you.This is what power is. You think you’re holding a leash onto others, but it’s actually a rope with a noose at both ends.I say that this path requires the cost of your soul, because your connection to your own emotions and your connection to the emotions of others, are both one in the same. Your consciousness is shared with everyone, and vice versa. To accept this is to walk the path of light and Love. It is to step into internal stability and authenticty that can never be shaken, no matter your external circumstances. To renounce this truth is to renouce your very humanity.The power to choose is within you. How will you relate to yourself and to others? Fear or Love?The fork in the road is before you and it’s time to move. Which will it be?",

            "content": "No tears in the writer, no tears in the reader. No surprise in the writer, no surprise in the reader.–Robert FrostI am thrilled with the feedback from my last post—a tear-jerker for any who attempts reading it. It’s a story that took me two years to write… not that I was actively writing it the whole time. I desperately wanted to share my story sooner. I wanted to send it to newspapers, accompanied with my own rude political-cartoon style illustrations mocking the mental healthcare system, but I couldn’t do it. I was too angry.I couldn’t let myself share my story until I let myself empathize with mental healthcare practitioners—the people I called and left countless unanswered voicemails for help—desperate cries drowned in a sea of others. I had to stop wanting to tear them down and instead see things from their perspective: the overwhelm and frustration that comes from needing to solve urgent problems with the wrong set of tools. You do your best to cover gashing wounds with band-aids, but the line of wailing wounded is going out the door.I couldn’t let myself write about my experiences with family mental illness until I let myself empathize with mass killing shooters. It is a topic that you think I would be at the forefront of discussing—but until then—I could do nothing but look away.I couldn’t let myself write my story until I let myself feel all of the pain again. My story has encouraged others to write about their experiences, and I am thrilled for this: we need all the perspectives we can get. But I warn you, this is not easy. The following outlines my writing process, along with common pitfalls that experience has taught me to avoid.Writing is a feeling process. Thinking brain, move aside and make room for your heart. I’ve tried to make this a logical and predictable system, with writing schedules, to-do lists, and reliable routines, but it never fails to fail.Writing from the heart is unpredictable. It requires the visit of a certain elusive guest, a mysterious woman named Inspiration. I used to consider waiting for inspiration to strike as silly—real artists get to work consistently—don’t they? But the more experience I get, the more I learn that forcing myself to write when I’m not inspired doesn’t help me or the reader. It’s tiring work, and tiring to read.Inspiration only visits those who are happy in her absence. She can smell desperation from a mile way and hates to be tied down, so don’t even try. Once you accept that your life does not revolve around her, she will happily visit. This creative process is about all steps involved: how to entice Inspiration to visit, how to be a welcome host, and what to do in her absence.The Inspired Writing Process  The Invitation: Intentions and Questions  Serendipitous Research  False Starts and Starting Over  Inspiration Knocks: Writing and Crying—it all flows out  Editing, but mostly, Deleting  Publishing1. The Invitation: Intentions and QuestionsThere is something burning within you. Something that needs to get out. Something that you don’t fully understand yet.Focus on that.You might not even have words for it. Maybe it’s just a feeling. Your starting point doesn’t need to be big, just big enough to stand on. This feeling tells you where you are, guiding you through an unfolding journey, and helps bring you back from the unknown with newfound understanding.Elaborate on that feeling. What is it? What needs to be understood? What questions do you want to be answered?The first step of writing, incedentally, is not writing, but asking questions. These questions give your work the laser-focus it needs so that when Inspiration does her rounds, you’re on her list, and she knows what to give you.Maybe you’ve had experiences in your life that you don’t understand. There’s unfinished business, unanswered questions and unresolved traumas. Or simply things that you are curious about. For me, my questions have to do with the mind. For instance:  How does mental illness present itself in the animal kingdom? Do other animals exhibit similar symptoms?  What can be learned about mental illness from non-Western cultures? What are other perspectives?  What alternative therapies have been benefical to healing these symptoms?It may be strange to consider writing equal parts teaching and learning, but I can see it no other way. Every time I start a new post, I’m just as surprised at how it is unfolding as you are. On the other hand, if you are stubborn and not open to the twisting path opening before you, your work will feel linear and dull.Writing from Inspiration requires faith. It can be hard listening to her. I like the certainty of having a writing schedule. Blindly following Inspiration requires faith that the next step won’t be off a cliff, but instead will be to higher ground, giving you a birds-eye view on your questions.With questions in hand as your acting GPS, and faith in its functionality, you’re ready to research.2. Serendipitous ResearchInstead of letting the fear of uncertainty paralyze you, let it excite you. You never know where unanswered questions will lead you.Adventure awaits.I don’t feel the inspiration to write nearly as much as the inspiration to research.Rather than fretting about the inspiration that is absent, focus on what desires are present. There is never a vacuum of intention. Maybe instead of writing, you feel compelled to research, or to watch a movie. Listen to that. You never know how seemingly unrelated things will connect.For example, I recently started researching about psychopaths—into understanding individuals that struggle to empathize with others, or even, want to harm others. In taking a break from that, I decided to randomly watch the first thing I found on Netflix. The opening line of the short series was: “I’m James. I’m 17. And I’m pretty sure I’m a psychopath.” Boom.I let out a laugh, haha. There’s no escaping my research! (The show was The End of the F***ing World.)These kinds of meaningful coincidences, or synchronicities, happen to me all the time, but only when I listen to Inspiration.NotesCapture your notes in whatever way feels natural. If you’re finding it hard to stay organized, you might benefit from this notecard cataloging system that’s popular among nonfiction authors.I just recently set up my own notecard system. The hardest part is deciding which categories, and even sub-categories, are useful for your questions. From there, decide how to organize. You can use tabs, color-coded cards, or what I do, which is buy circle stickers and put them on the side.It’s a useful and simple referencing system that I see myself building on for my whole life.3. False Starts and Starting OverOften I will get inspiration to write, but it won’t be enough to finish the idea to completion. I’ve started to piece things together, but it doesn’t feel like the exploration phase has wrapped up yet. What results is a half-finished post that I probably won’t look at again. I have many of those.It’s taken me a while to not get discouraged when this happens, but instead to view it as part of the process. False starts refine my questions so I know what to look into next, allowing me to repeat the previous two steps. I find that the more I repeat this cycle, the richer the final result ends up being—almost like a slow cooking process. It’s worth the wait.4. Inspiration Knocks: Writing and Crying—it all flows outMy story flooded out of me during 10 hours while laying down in bed, frantically typing words on my phone instead of sleeping. No sleep, food, or water. As it poured out of me, I could think of nothing else. I didn’t even realize that I had pulled an all-nighter until I was finished.Inspiration is like that. Her presence is electric. There’s a reason her visits require you to be in a good shape, mentally and physically. She takes a toll!The intensity of her vists depend on the emotions involved, because…You Need to Feel EverythingThe more painful the memories you are expressing, the harder this will be. There is no shame in shelving stories until you are ready. Face them only when the experience promises to be cathartic.If I had written my story from a logical place, it would have been chronological. I would have listed important details, the facts. It would read like your standard newspaper article. You know how inspiring those are.You’ll notice that my story isn’t linear. I jumped around the timeline based on the emotional pacing.Nothing gives you the clarity needed to shift through your experiences to determine the gold nuggets from the dirt, like intense feelings. I had no idea when I started writing that the knife-safe would be mentioned at all, but when reliving everything, I realized how important this detail actually was.Tapping into the emotions of your memories make them vivid. It distorts them, highlighting what is profound from what is extraneous. This is not a technique to use for objectivity, but objectivity isn’t what we want right now. Empathy is. Close the door and cry.Here you have a choice. You can trigger the painful feelings and memories, bring them up from their depths, or wait for something else to eventually do that for you.I did the latter. The evening before writing, I was having a defensive conversation with a friend that was getting out of hand. It unearthed my memories of powerlessness again… I had already been crying as I laid down for bed, and I figured that I might as well capture as much of these memories while I could because I didn’t want to relive them again later…I’m glad I did.5. Editing, but mostly, DeletingLet out a sigh of relief because it’s all downhill from here.Writing, while being the most intense step, is also the briefest. Inspiration’s surprise visit has changed your life, but she also left you with a mess to clean up, so let’s get to work.This is where your thinking brain comes. While total objectivity is boring, total subjectivity is exhausting. We need a balance. We tell the facts, but with style.This is where you take what has poured out of you and read it from the perspective of someone who has never seen it before. Dry your tears, open the door and invite others in. Reading the work aloud to somebody who’s hearing it for the first time is a beneficial telepathic writing technique.Usually the first draft is longer than necessary. When editing, there’s an initial urge to add more, but resist the desire to hold the reader’s hand. It’s degrading and makes for a less suspenseful read.6. PublishingI work on a piece until the sense of completion washes over me. This isn’t about perfectionism, but about rediscovering the starting point of your journey as a changed person. That feeling within you, the things that needed to come out, the questions in need of answers, are they complete? Or is it time to venture out again?Trepidation, or a slight concern of “Will people like this?” is also a good feeling to accompany this. The awareness of this uncertainty shows me that I am putting out something new and untested. In making a stand for something, the feedback becomes more polarizing: people either love it or hate it. In accepting that, I’m ready to publish.Make your work an important part of your life, but not the only thing in your life. You can’t receive unless you are empty, in a receptive state of mind. Being frustrated about the lack of inspiration is the very thing that keeps her from visiting.A consequence of living according to self-love is that my actions are always dependent on Inspiration. It’s been a relief to realize that she is always present, if I only listen. You always feel inspired to do something, even if that something is to watch a movie. I find that the more I listen to her subtle voice, the happier I am, but also paradoxly, the more impactful my work becomes. I am able to work less, but the work I end up doing has a greater effect on people.To tap into the magic of inspired work, simply listen within. You know what to do.",

            "content": "This is going to be an uncomfortable read for you. Is there a topic that stirs more discomfort than mental illness?This is going to be a challenging read for you. Is there a field where our lack of understanding translates into the real premature cost of human life, of loved ones, of children, in violently horrific ways, more so than mental illness?And finally, if you are brave enough to keep reading, this is going to be an emotionally heart-wrenching read for you. We are plagued by mass shootings to the point of numbness, and yet, they keep happening. Is there a topic that makes us feel more powerless than mental illness?If you can stomach this read, even if you are the only person in the world who can, then the pain I have sifted through to bring you these blood-stained words will not have been in vain. My body shakes in-between sobs as I try to get this message to you. Just you. I couldn’t write this for everyone. I couldn’t make this easy. Nothing about this is easy.The most recent shooting took place in Florida, the state I call home, where I grew up. Palm trees and beaches line the memories of my mom needing to go to the hospital yet again in handcuffs, the experiences of which were not discussed afterwards. “What was mommy sick with?” I am 8 years old and confused. My dad teaches me a new word. “Bipolar.”Though you may learn a new word, that doesn’t mean that you can say it whenever you want, not even when you need to. Some words are like curse words; any relief you get in yelling them loudly is not worth the risk.F**k!The Florida sun beats down on the car to accent the embarrassment that has flushed my cheeks in a K-Mart parking lot. My mom used to work here, but not since she quit weeks ago. Inside she made a scene in front of her old coworkers as I stood aside with my brother, Matthew. He’s frustratingly too young to understand, and our matching red hair makes us stand out at a time where I’d give anything for invisibility. A former coworker puts his arm around my mom and asks with genuine concern, “Are you okay?” I want to run away.Minutes later we are in the car and my mom is calling the police yet again. The wait in between a 911 call and the cops arriving to file yet another report that is not true, but that they pretend to take seriously for my mom’s sake, stresses me out. I can’t take it anymore. The police report captures my loud arguing with my mom through the cellphone and ends poignantly: “Daughter hung up on me.” I was twelve.My family is in lots of police reports. It’s one thing to have painful memories, quite another to have them documented and on file at the police station down the road. Anytime I want, I can go there and get a freshly printed copy of them all: my family’s personal traumatic memory album that we never asked for, but make payments on nonetheless.I hold these police reports close to my chest as an anchor in this sea of chaos, proof to show the cops the next time they come knocking, that they need to trust me instead of my mom. Mom doesn’t know what she is talking about. Sometimes when they take her away, she comes back better. Not most of the time, but sometimes,and it’s a risk I’m willing to take. I love her so much.Bipolar might be a bad word, but it pales in comparison to Schizophrenia.Before I know it, I’m an adult and my brother is a teenager. We are still so cute together with our matching red hair. I look at his curls as he lays on the hospital bed, suffering from a neurological problem the doctors have yet to diagnose. They do more tests. They rule things out. Relief is followed by apprehension as they do more tests. They test and rule things out until there is one answer left.Schizophrenia.No. My eyes widen as adrenaline prepares me to fight this unseen assailant. Does this mean he will hear voices? What if they tell him to do bad things? Will he want to hurt people? Will he hurt us?There is nothing like the fear that comes after being told to not let your loved one be around sharp objects, but that they are otherwise ready to come home, and then scavenging the house to hide sharpened pencils. The key to the knife-safe hangs on your keychain as a reminder that you are not safe; frustratingly it’s not as physically heavy as it makes you feel for owning a knife-safe in the first place.There is nothing like the fear of standing in the doorway with your mom as you both look in terror as your brother destroys your home, knocking over a full dishrack of cermaics as they crash on the floor. Running over the rubble makes his feet bleed, but he runs unphased, and keeps destroying, a streak of red.The cops finally arrive. I don’t need to convince them to help, which is a relief because I can’t speak. They use handcuffs to take my brother to the place where our mom has to go sometimes too. I pray that this is one of the rare times where it works. My body shakes as I go back in the house and start picking up thousands of little broken pieces.Days later he is back home. Call 911 again. He returns to the mental hospital.A week later, welcome home. Days later, call 911. He goes back again.Again and again, through the revolving door of our modern mental healthcare system.Albert Einstein said the definition of insanity was doing the same thing over and over again but expecting different results. Is not our treatment of the insane... insane?My mom was not feeling well. The stress was getting to her, but she was proactive. She called her doctor and made sure she had ample supply of her mood-stabilizers–not as colorful as Matt’s new anti-psychotics, but they match nonetheless.I can get mad at my mom sometimes, but I can never say that she is a bad mother. She is the most loving person I have ever met. With Matt’s new diagnosis, she is prepared to do anything to help, even make her world revolve around him, easy enough transition for a long-term stay-at-home mom already. I see homeschooling books on the kitchen table, and school is in session every morning.No amount of book-learning could cover the guilt and devastation my mom felt for passing on the gene of insanity to her son. She had given him life, would give her own life for his if need be, but on a fundamental level, had doomed him. She calls from a church at three in the morning feeling suicidal. An ambulance answers her cry for help by taking her to the place that sometimes helps, and she is back home within an hour. Quick treatment, we are told, because she just needed a nap.I lived in the unpredictable chaos of my mom and brother going in and out of the insane revolving door of mental hospitals for six months. The knife-safe key still felt heavy in my pocket as my mom’s erradic spending habit and collection of cats grew to frightening proportions. My anxiety surmounts to levels I never knew were possible and sometimes it all escapes out of me in the form of a scream.When not collapsing from countless sleepless nights, I call people for help. I call my mom’s psychiatrist and leave a message every day. I can tell the receptionist is getting annoyed.He never calls me back.My mom’s delusions increase and she starts hearing things. Strange, you would think, for a person with bipolar to hear voices? But then again, my brother as a schizophrenic would have mood swings too. What a murky mess this method of diagnosis is. Maybe even a little insane?As fear for my mom’s safety increased, I take matters into my own hands by convincing her to get in the car so we can get help. I drive her to the other end of the county to another mental hospital. I hope that this one is not insane and instead helps most of the time.She refused to get out of the car, and I am told that she cannot be admitted against her will. Eventually I coax her out of the car and by some act of God, she is admitted.Her admittance is longer than normal this time, more than a few days, which gives me hope. After two weeks, she is home, and soon we enjoy Thanksgiving dinner together as a family. I send out Thank You cards to the people who finally helped my mom. I am relieved. We had so much to be thankful for. I fill myself to the brim with my mom’s mashed potatoes and smiles.***I wish I could end my message to you right here, on this message of hope and trust in the mental health system. I wish I could tell you that we lived happily ever after so that you could sleep soundly… But this is not a fairytale, and I am wide awake at 4:30 in the morning, taking a deep breath, because the hardest parts are yet to come.***\"We are still mad about the mad. We still don't understand them and that lack of understanding makes us mean and arrogant, and makes us mislead ourselves, and so we hurt them.\"- David CohenMy feet drag across the pavement as I go to the police station to get yet another report.I don’t want to read it, but I need to know what happened. I wasn’t there.Reading it makes me breakdown.The thing about medications is that they suck.Anti-psychotics and mood-stabilizers mess with more than your head. They make a lot of people gain weight, have muscle spasms and tremors, and experience regular dizziness, drowsiness, vomiting, and the list goes on. I don’t blame my mom for not wanting to take them anymore.But at the time I was mad.Within weeks of her newfound stability, she was spiraling out of control again. I ask her to take her meds. She takes so many, it requires an Excel spreadsheet to organize, which I make, and lay each pill out for her. I plead.She refuses.That night, I gave up. I decided I wouldn’t try to get her help anymore. Nothing was working and it was consuming my life in trying.If I knew what would happen 24 hours later, I would not have stopped trying.Death, with time, comes with a sense of finality, of peace, and of closure for loved ones. This is not a story of death.On this fateful day, I left my mom in order to work. My plan was to work to escape this madhouse that my home had become.She stops me at the door, barely able to speak. I can tell she is upset and scared. She says she loves me with all her heart and soul. I say I love her too.I walk out the door.The next time I see her, I will not recognize her. The person in front of me is not my mom, but a balloon. I didn’t know that the human body could swell to the point where you couldn’t see it’s teeth.Staring at what used to be my mom hooked up to an array of medical equipment–her life fully supported by machines and hanging by a thread, the result of a car accident where she walked out in front of traffic after some eight hours of walking without food or water as a diabetic. Was she suicidal? What were her thoughts? Was she thinking at all?I wish I knew.At the trauma center, my brother disturbs our concentration from the beeps of life support machines to tell us what the demons are telling him, his pupils dialated to it’s max with adrenaline-enriched fear. The knife-safe key hangs heavy in my pocket as I cry.Three weeks in a coma, and months of rehab, while my mom was healing, I stepped in to help my dad by taking care of my brother. I started up the same cycle again. Taking him to appointments. Calling 911. Seeing him go in and out of the insane place that sometimes helps people if they are psychotic enough, but usually not.During an especially bad episode, he was talking about what God, the Devil, the angels, and a whole cast of other characters were telling him. He was frightened.I opened my mouth to give him my usual reassurances. To tell him none of this was real.It wasn’t going to work. I was going insane. I was doing the same thing over and over again, expecting different results. So I tried something else.He needed so desperately for somebody to believe him without judging him or trying to lock him up. Every adult in his life was telling him how broken he was, how it is only going to get worse from here, and how he can’t trust his own mind.As he told me his experiences, I shut off my judgements, opened my heart as wide as I could, and I told him: “I believe you. I believe you can get better. I believe you can learn to control this.”That conversation lasted a full day.No new information was said, I just kept having to repeat my newfound beliefs to him. He would go to his room, and come back, shaking in fear, feeling like something was about to hurt him, or that I might even hurt him. He had no memory of what I had said just half an hour ago. So again, I would tell him “I believe you. I believe you can get better. I believe you can learn to control this. You are safe. I love you.”Then I would invite him to sit and relax, a technique called meditation to quiet the mind. Minutes later, he would come back to me, shaking again, terrified. “Are you going to kill me?” “No honey, absolutely not.” I would tell him again. I believe you. You will be fine. You can learn to control this.We did this with all day long, and you know what?He hasn’t had an episode since.I’m not saying the medicine doesn’t help, but he would have episodes even on the medicine. He hasn’t had a single episode since, and he didn’t need his medicine adjusted. The curse of chronic chaos was lifted, not by chemicals, but by empathy. Now he talks to me about his past experiences or current painful thoughts because he knows I believe him. He trusts me. The medicine and practitioners didn’t give us that. I had to do that.He’s enrolled back in school again and doesn’t need a full-time caregiver anymore. We threw away that wretched knife-safe and key. I am proud of him as if he was my own son.Schizophrenia, Bipolar, Mental Illness. These are no longer bad words to me. I say them freely without fear.We project our worst fears into the unknown–what we don’t understand, and what we don’t understand will continue to perpetuate.To understand the crazy, we need to stop being afraid of being crazy. It is not an contagious affliction, but a perspective that we have not been listening to.Any physical fear is nothing compared to the fear that comes after being told that you are insane. To be told that your mind, your thoughts, your emotions, are the enemy that there is no escape from.On top of that being told that it is never going to get better. With enough repetition, you start to believe that…  You are powerless.  You will get worse.  You are not in control.  You are bad.  You are broken.  You are a monster.  There is no hope.If I told you any of the above, would you want to believe it? Would you if your life depended on it? How would that make you feel?During episodes, sometimes my brother would yell.Have you noticed that people only raise their voices when they feel like they aren’t being listened to?When a person learns that if they express their negative experiences, their darkest thoughts, then they will be, not only outcasted, but also forcibly hospitalized and made to take pills that make them sick, and turned into a monster with no future, do you think that makes people inclined to talk?It can be hard to let go of a current perspective, but  it’s the only way to be able to consider alternatives. It took me having a mental breakdown and calling the Suicide Hotline in order to even begin to accept that my view of mental health was not working. To paraphrase the soft-spoken caller on duty who spoke straight to my trapped desperation: He said I was insane–that I was going in circles doing the same things over and over again and that nothing would change until I broke the cycle. It was hard to let go. I had done everything I was told. I asked for help from people who had degrees. But none of it was working.Science research into the mind, we tell ourselves, will one day give us the answers we need. Sure, I believe this.But I didn’t have one day.I had lost my mom and at risk of losing my brother, in addition to skirting precarious suicidal thoughts myself. I had to do something differently in order to survive.With all of the advancements modern medicine has brought us in terms of healing the body, our understanding of the brain, the mind, of memory, of thought, remains a blank page yet to be written. I don’t know how many shootings need to happen before we accept that we don’t know anything about this.It is not natural to want to harm others. Think about the beliefs and previous experiences you would have needed to have in the past to be remotely close to the kind of experience of a mass killing shooter. Does attempting to empathize with such a “monster” cause you extreme inner turmoil?I told you this was not going to be easy.Emotions are contagious. Consciously or not, we tend to make people feel how we feel. When we are angry, that causes anger in others. When we are terrified, that causes terror in others.The extent of suffering and powerlessness in the victims of shootings show how much suffering and powerlessness the shooter has. That suffering was there before the attack, and the attack was the release of it, the spread. Is it uncomfortable to consider a person with a gun, a killer, feeling powerless?Quite frankly, we need to feel uncomfortable. We need to consider perspectives that challenge us on fundamental levels. If you think mental health in America is working, I would like to introduce you to my mom.In recovering from the car accident, after three weeks of a coma, three months of rehab for a Traumatic Brain Injury, and a lifetime ride’s worth on the rollercoaster of hope and despair, my mom is not dead or alive. Sometimes she remembers us, sometimes she speaks nonsense, and sometimes she doesn’t say anything at all. We visit and talk to her sometimes. She can’t take care of herself, and taking care of her is more than a full time job, so her home is one full of nurses.I wish I could go back and stop myself from taking her to the insane place against her will. I wish I could stop myself from screaming at her to take her medicine. It didn’t work when I was 12, so of course it didn’t work when I was 20. I wish we could stop being insane and just listen instead.But I can’t go back, and neither can you. We have to keep moving forward. We have to believe that the pain we endure teaches us something valuable if we only listen.I’m tired of the insanity. It’s exhausting doing the same thing over and over again expecting things to be different. It’s time to try other things. I’m not saying I have all of the answers, but I have forty books about the mind in my online shopping cart and am determined to understand, to listen, and to keep sharing my thoughts.Envision a world where mass shootings can be spoken of in past tense, an era long gone. It won’t pass until we have learned from it, until we listen.Are you listening?I believe you.I believe you can get better.I believe you can learn to control this.",

            "content": "My illustration output and rendering skills have exploded these last few months; the above being the most recent piece I did. In this post I retrospectively share my work and resources I’ve been devouring on the quest to becoming a better visual communicator everyday.For those interested in following the journey, every little sketch at a time, you can find me regularly posting on Instagram: @amandalynnelliott.I am now also accepting commissions. Everything from simple sketches to elaborate complex scenes full of color. If you’re interested, message me here.Alligator GhostlandA big breakthrough I’ve had is embracing color and backgrounds. The above comic pages were heavily inspired by two things:  Austin Holcomb’s Night Physics Comic focusing on the elusive topic of dreams in beautiful pastel and psychedelic color palettes. With relatable characters and compelling themes like sexual ethics, suburban legends, ancient myths, and haunted houses, his work was an excellent pitstop for my studies.  Colette Baron-Reid’s Invizion Process, which is a kind of wakeful dreaming. While awake, in a meditative state, you ask yourself, “Where am I,” and allow your inner terrain to reveal itself. There are no right or wrong answers, but a process of letting your imagination guide you. Depending on your emotions, your inner landscape can be treacherous with storms, or you may have been wandering a deserted wasteland, with no hope for nourishment for miles. There are also pleasant inner landscapes full of abundance, like meadows, beaches, and lush paradises. Colette’s method shows us how to utilize our imaginative powers to establish where we are so that we can learn necessary lessons, heal, and progress forward into new lands, thus growing emotionally.The comic was the result of me doing that process, dealing heavily on how I used to have reoccuring nightmares about alligators and my propensity towards workaholism.A big part of embracing backgrounds has been to embrace where I live–Florida. I’ve spent so much time wanting to be somewhere else, but a tour of the country has given me an appreciation of it’s green palm trees, beaches, and, of course, alligators!Continuing that train of thought, I did the next piece, drawing heavy inspiration from the local downtown area.Crow and RabbitAs a picture-making, paint-splashing bunny, this is about my partnership with a developer, portrayed here as a programming crow.I am currently animating the rabbit and will share it along with a post about animation.For a long time I've struggled with illustrating hilly and mountainous landscapes, and it wasn't until my trip that I realized why: I've been surrounded by the flatness of Florida this whole time! I didn't have any visuals to draw from. All the more reason to travel.FundamentalsComplex work is nothing more than the intertwining of basic skills, rightfully called, fundamentals, because all else is built on top of them. Here I share recent progress on the basic skills of color, rendering, perspective, and storytelling.COLORA couple years ago, I simplified my drawing tools by deciding only to draw in black ink. The results of this stretch beyond my work. As I write this, I’m wearing a green shirt, purple hoodie, and red socks… I’ve been working without color for so long that I’ve been overcompensating with a blaring wardrobe that rarely ever matches!I had some trepidation in re-committing myself to visual work, so I asked for a sign that I’m on the right path. The day after ordering a watercolor set and my decision to reintroduce color into my bland palette, I saw this rainbow while on my morning run. Not bad!In addition to being inspired by Austin Holcomb’s work with color, I admire the work of David Catrow, a modest illustrator of over 70 children’s books! His colors and textures are so vibrant and playful, you can tell he’s a guy that has fun with his work.The key to color success seems to be in limiting your color palette. This is an area that I’m not super confident in yet, but here are resources that have helped me so far.Color resources:  Sycra - How to Choose Colours that Work!  Brandon Dayton - How to Choose Colors to Make Awesome Palettes - The KGamut tool mentioned here is very useful.RenderingThe road to realistic rendering is to constantly observe the world around you. To be successful at this is, only study what you are genuinely interested in. If you aren’t interested in what’s before you, move on with a clean break, no hard feelings. It was you, not them! They’ll understand.Sometimes the most interesting thing is to look where everyone isn’t looking.When I was at Mount Rushmore I was more interested in the infrastructure and activity surrounding the monument than the monument itself. A collection of hundreds of people, all taking the same kind of photos, oblivious to everybody else around them, and gone within a few mintues. Instead of taking those very same pictures, I instead took pictures of people taking pictures!There is so much to observe about life. A sketchbook is a fabulous companion for this process.Rendering resources:  Kim Jung Gi’s live drawings will show you what is possible. His incredible visual memory is the artistic equivalent to the first runner to accomplish the 4-minute-mile, showing us what is possible. I gleamed a lot from his lectures.  Modern Day James breaks down this process in his Becoming a Gi series. Just watch it for the funny intro and you won’t be disappointed.  Alphonso Dunn’s pen and ink videos bring rendering down-to-earth in these easily digestible videos. Below are a couple studies I drew from his work.PerspectivePerspective, or the illusion of three-dimensional space on a flat surface, is a beast that I’ve been avoiding for a long time, but it guards the most powerful world-building tool known to man.Again, the best way to learn is to observe it in action.Perspective resources:  DrawaBox has a great compilation of lessons, challenges, and community around understanding and conveying the solidity and weight of forms and how they relate to one another in 3D space.  Framed Perspective Vol 1 by master artist Marcos Mateu-Mestre. Just got my copy and I’ve been reading it over breakfast every morning.STORYTELLINGAn insight into storytelling came from studying the breathtaking work of late master comic artist, Moebius. When looking at his illustrations, I feel like I’m entering a dynamic world, with real breathing characters, and complexities that reach beyond a single static image. How did he accomplish this? What makes his work so compelling?It seems that the answer here is same as it is for questions like, why is Game of Thrones such a compelling story?What makes people read stories, written or visual, is that they are interesting. It seems obvious enough, but it’s a challenging feat to accomplish. As a creator, it’s like having your audience on a fishing line. They come for the intrigue, the questions they have–that’s the bait. For instance, here are some questions for my recent piece:  What time period are these guys from?  Why is that guy on the donkey like that?  Is the donkey real or trained to be ridden like that?… You get the idea.It’s the detail that lends to intrigue, a weird outfit for instance, and that’s where rendering comes into play. Then it’s tools like perspective that add a layer of wonder in making the scenario believable.But it’s not enough to entice an audience into just asking questions and answering them all right away. That’s letting them swim away with the bait–no! You have to reel them in by giving them some answers–some, not all–and ideally in a way that presents new questions as old ones are answered.Think about story in all the movies and shows you enjoy. The second things become predictable, it’s boring. We humans are curious and love investigating, and it’s the job of the storyteller to build something with the intention not to show everything, to instead keep the audience in the dark. The more that is hidden, like a massive iceberg underwater, the more rich, concentrated, dynamic, and real those parts of the world that you grasp at feels.Compelling illustrations bring out the wonder in people, and this makes sense. When you are wondering, your eyes are wandering, looking for answers to the questions that the creator made for you to ask.Is this illustration static, like characters posing for a photo, or are characters mid-movement? What were they doing before and what will they do after this moment you are capturing? These are the questions I let guide me.Only one resource for storytelling. It has inspired me greatly: Moebius AKA Jean Giraud - 18 Wisdom-Filled Tips to Aspiring Artists.The Process of ReinventionInspired by an article called The 4 Phases Of Developing Your Creative Voice.All creators learn by mimicing. All bands I know started as cover bands. All novelists are ferocious readers. Artists copy other artists as necessity.Do enough of this, then you feel compelled to break out and do your own thing. Practice technique enough, and you don’t have to consciously think about it anymore, liberating it to become a play-thing for your subconscious to express itself. The advice here is to start small and build your confidence up to the big things. Novelists started with short stories. Musicians started with riffs. Artists with fundamentals.Then eventually you realize your limited range of expression. Growth stops, you feel like your work is a lie, and it’s time to discover the new tools of your next reinvention.This is my path. Walk with me?***You can follow my work on Instagram.

            "content": "I went to a psychic a while ago. Simply guided by curiosity, I didn’t have any specific concerns, but I left with a bad taste in my mouth.She didn’t say anything explicitly bad, but I walked in expecting a discussion and reflection on life, while what I got were some shallow predictions about general improvements to my life that did not impress me.We have a tendency to view the future as static, fixed, and mostly removed from our control. There’s a tendency to view reality with the cold detachment of a scientific researcher: as if everything can be reduced to the goofy meaningless randomness of colliding atoms that is, again, outside of the control of us mere mortals.This is such a powerless world-view to have. It makes us wrought with worry and anxiety; as if we are wandering through a thick fog, and anything we stumble upon, be it a million dollars, or a deadly fall off a cliff, would be a total accident.Luckily, this powerless worldview is entirely optional.You are in control.Here are examples of powerful beliefs:  You are in control of your life.  You make your future.  Your present is what your past self has made for you.Don’t anxiously wait and see what the future has in store for you, make it. Command whatever you want into being.You are a sovereign individual and nobody has control over your thoughts, even if you are incarcerated. Even if your external world and physical body is trapped, your thoughts are always under your directive. That it in of itself is a comforting thought to have.It all starts with your thoughts. Your life is the story you tell yourself about who you are.These thoughts form beliefs and build momentum as actions and habits, and before you know it, the story your life that you’ve been telling yourself is already past tense and it’s time for you to write something new.No matter what change you want to make in your life, such as losing weight, earning more money, living addiction free, developing meaningful relationships, it all starts with accepting where you are right now, and the responsibility that comes with that. If drastic changes are desired, you don’t have to linger in guilt or regret for long, because this state is what your old self has made for you. You’re done with that. Let it go.IntentionCreating your life is accomplished by setting a series of intentions, which almost always stem from a desire to grow, to challenge yourself, explore, to do something you have never done before. Set one intention, make progress, learn from it, and then set another.Living life without intentions is like being adrift at sea. You might get to where you want to go, or you might crash into a reef.Intentions are different than goals. You can intend for something to happen all you want, but if it misses the mark, in the eyes of a goal-setter, you’ve failed. Goals have too much baggage attached to them. We tend to equate a goal’s success or failure with our self-worth, and they tend to give way to a destructive kind of tunnel vision. Speaking as somebody that has worked herself in the ground on multiple occasions, the potentional harm that goal-setting has on my personal relationships simply isn’t worth it anymore.To summarize my point: Goals are about the destination, while intentions are about the journey. If the goal is heaven, but the path is paved with fiery brimestone and calamity, is it really worth it?ExpectationsSetting intentions leads to clearer expectations and boundaries. It’s easier to say no to abusive relationships and say yes to healthy ones. You are more likely to get what you want once you’ve clearly stated exactly what that is.  Problems in relationships, whether they be friendships, romantic, professional, come from miscommunicated expectations.It’s hard to relate to people without knowing their intentions. It’s harder being in a relationship with them. It’s like being caught in a chaotic whirlpool, being pulled in every which direction, but with no meaningful progress made.When people don’t explicitly state and pursue their desires, then the only option left available for them to satisfy those desires is subconsciously, which can lead to habits of manipulation. Things are going great, until all of a sudden, they aren’t. The trademark of being manipulated is walking on eggshells around the person and always feeling guilty. It’s easy to violate the expectations and desires of others when they aren’t clearly made. Manipulation is a topic that warrants it’s own post entirely, but for now, let’s move on.Indecision“But what if I make the wrong decision?”The quickest way to find out if a decision is good or bad for you is simply to act. It’s in action that we gain vital decision-making information.In sitting on your laurels “trying the make the best decision,” you take on the exhausting task of envisioning all potential choices and outcomes, and weighing them all against each other. With the strategy, overcome with self-doubt, no decision is made unless it is forced by some external factor, or the golden answer that is eventually uncovered is so precious that we become too attached to the outcome. It’s perfection paralyzes us.It’s like spending months on the perfect business plan, anxiously launching, only to discover that, not only is it not a good business idea, but more importantly, you wouldn’t be passionate about growing or maintaining it in the first place. (I may have done this a few times…)Alternatively, once you get an idea, you could immediately act, receive feedback, both internal and external, and adjust accordingly, without attaching your self-worth to the outcome. It’ll spare yourself a lot of grief, and allow you to view life as exactly what it is: one giant learning experiment!Delaying action takes many forms: excel spreadsheets, calendars, mile-long to-do lists. All of that busy work can be oh-so-tempting. It’s taken a while, but I’ve stopped kidding myself. I hardly plan the day ahead, let alone weeks or months like I used to try. I accept now that I work best with a vague vision of the future, and my projects take me about a few months out, but the second an interesting opportunity arises or my priorities change, I adapt without hesitation. I find myself planning less and acting more, learning more, and I’m all the happier for it.The DevilHere’s something to think about when faced with a hard decision.The Devil tarot card is the most feared and misunderstood. Upon seeing the most sinister character to ever exist, it’s easy to imagine an abyss of evil where all your worst fears are realized.But here lies the trick, the card up the Devil’s sleeve, so to say. Fear is not the punishment, but the tool. The bondage is not some eternal hell in an afterlife, but the life lived avoiding going after what you desire, avoiding diving into the challenges that invigorate you with life, and instead opting for a safe survival free of the responsibility of deciding where to go next. Don’t worry, everything will be okay. Put the chain on your neck, and you’ll never have to make a scary decision ever again.  Look closely at the card, and you’ll see that the chains on the man and woman are loose and could easily be removed. The Devil cannot take control without ongoing permission.The Devil, far from evil incarnate, is actually the caretaker of those who refuse to take care of themselves. Actually, can you think of anything more evil than the act of freely giving up your free will?Worrying about the future invites the very fear that the Devil’s bondage feeds on. With enough practice, it becomes silly to worry about something you feel in control of.When faced with a decision, seriously ask yourself, what do you want? Which path challenges you towards exalted happiness, and which sounds like the comforting clanking of the limited mobility of chains?ReflectionIt’s imperative to define your intentions for moving forward, along with the fears and limiting beliefs that are holding you back. It’s only in understanding your fears that they don’t control you anymore. The only way to remain true to yourself and to the life you desire is to maintain a practice of reflection.Reflection requires the ability to be alone with your own thoughts long enough so that your inner demons may make themselves known, a length of time that in this age of easy distractions seems like an unnecessary torment. But the brave investment always pays off in spades, because there is an calm eye at the center of every storm, no matter how violent. Once there, you can observe your tumultuous emotions as they swirl around you, and you can finally learn what they are here to teach you.  The word emotion literally translates to “energy in motion.” Emotions can’t be efficiently suppressed. Their very presence demands attention. Let them flow through you. See what they are here to teach you.If you don’t understand the motives of your actions, chances are, those motives are not your own. Where are you conforming to the expectations of others? How would it be feel to be free of those shackles? Why don’t you just take them off, the imprisonment has always been an illusion anyways.Liberation of any material kind (of health, money, love, etc) is rooted first and foremost in the liberation of the mind.There was a man playing piano in this meadow at Yosemite National Park.Make your future. Make it as colorful as you want. Venture into the smoky unknown confident of what you’ll find on the other side.For more on this interesting archetype, I recommend the work of Napoleon Hill who authored the famous Think and Grow Rich. Specifically, his controversial book, Outwitting the Devil. In it he documents a conversation he had with the personification of fear, so called \"the Devil,\" and gets him to confess all the tricks he uses to manipulate people into giving up their free will to him. Written in 1938, Hill's wife prevented the book's publication for fear of public outcry. Enough immediate family members passed away, and it wasn't published until a few years ago, though it's relevance to today is alarming and it hits close to home in many areas.***If you visit a psychic, take what they say with a grain of salt… then chunk that salt over your left shoulder into the Devil’s eye! You are making your future right now and you have complete creative license. Make it a masterpiece.",

            "content": "Over two months ago I packed my little car to the brim with my belongings, and roadtripped with a beloved 3,000 miles, catching many a landmark and animal crossing in between.It was my first roadtrip to the West coast, jam-packed with activities like hiking, horseback riding in a national park, visiting sacred sites, and the like. An exhilarating, albeit exhausting trip (I may have broke down sobbing multiple times, but more on that later) that I will no doubt be dripping with inspiration from for the rest of my life.I was looking forward to the end of the exhaustion. The schedule and budget was tight, so most nights were spent sleeping in the car. I hardly remember driving through the whole state of Colorado, fatigue combined with my anxiety about cliff driving* has made the memories fuzzy.*Florida is FLAT.I also recall being in the middle-of-nowhere South Dakota, in pitch black darkness, having to swerve to avoid hitting deer bolting out in front of the car. Passing by multiple cars that were broke down, each having met a deer on bad terms, did not lessen my anxiety… Even as a longterm driver, this was new to me.Funny how my most anxious moments were not encountering the bison and elk at Yellowstone!\t\tIf you want to catch the wildlife at Yellowstone, do what we did: sleep outside the entrance at night. When you wake up and drive through, all of the animals will be stirring.Looking forward to relief, after over a week on the road we got to the apartment and slept. I woke up to needing to start my job right away, a full day on my feet. There was little rest.I stayed three weeks before deciding to move back.Wrong ReasonsI jumped into moving to Seattle for the wrong reasons. I thought I was missing something. I thought I needed to learn from people who had the thing I was “missing.”Having not traveled much, my criticism of my hometown had been building for some time, but when faced with the reality of city-living, I realized the value of what I had given up. From the trip I’d learned that the places I were drawn to were not the cities, but the wide open spaces and farms. I’ve been devouring information on homesteading, of all things, and fantasizing about the self-sufficiency that could be attained by growing my own food, making my own hygiene products, having solar panels, and the like.Moving forced me to learn a hard lesson in priorities (again). I had prioritized my career pursuits over my relationships, all while forgetting that relationships are what give meaning to life. Career success without relationships to share them with are meaningless. Once I got to Seattle, there was a heavy “Now what?” looming over me. Now that I was surrounded my potential opportunities, I didn’t care to pursue them. My heart was back home.It’s funny how sometimes we don’t feel good enough for the relationships we have, but in going out to “prove ourselves” we put that very thing we cherish most in jeopardy.Make your decisions from a positive place of love, not fear. Instead of running away from what you don’t want, run towards what you do.DecidingDeciding to move back was messy. It hurt feelings.  The word decide comes from the root word “cide” which means to cut or kill. Making decisions literally translates to cutting off potential possibilities.I spent a few days thinking about it, the decision to stay or go, logically, until I realized that I already knew what I wanted.When you’re at a crossroads, your heart has already decided where to go. Simply ask yourself: Which one do you hope it is?Or better yet, flip a coin for it. Your heart will rise or fall when the coin answers, and you’ll know what you truly want.At the end of the day, you feel how you feel. It’s tempting to resist or hide these feelings to avoid hurting others, but lying to yourself and others just prolongs the hurt. Sometimes things don’t work, relationships or jobs aren’t a good fit, or you get what you want only to realize that you don’t want it anymore.You have a choice: be true to your feelings, act on them, and feel authentic and inspired, or resist them and feel tired, along with a whole host of other negative emotions. The path of going after what you want is what leads to growth. Go with the flow like plants. It’s not hard to grow, it’s hard to delay and resist growth. Ask yourself: Which path leads to growth? and then don’t be afraid to cut out those possibilities that don’t serve you.Once you get what you want, you learn from it, and then you may want something else. There’s only one way to find out.Moving BackMoving back required getting an oil change, new tires on the car, and another roadtrip across country, this time with another beloved.I felt tremendously relieved the second I picked him up from the airport. We got home and didn’t have power for a week from the Hurricane Irma fallout, and it didn’t bother us one bit.I am relieved to be back home. It took moving 3,000 miles away for me to realize that home wasn’t where I was, but who I was with.",

            "content": "I am back in Florida now, but my stay will be short, as after some thinking, I’ve decided… This summer I’m moving to Seattle, Washington!It’s quite a surprise to be moving clear across on the country like this, but it feels right. During my two week visit I was expecting to discover things that would make me hesitant, but it just confirmed for me that it’s the right place and time to take the leap!Thankfully, the task of moving is not on me alone, as I’m moving in with Dante, who I stayed with during my visit.I’m excited about a non-art job that awaits me there. While the move is in large part for the career opportunities that await, I’m looking forward to mentally separating making money from my creative work for a change. Derek Siver’s post on balance has inspired my thoughts here.For a long time, I’ve been hell-bent on self-employment and making money with my creativity, even at the expense of my self-esteem and body. I put it all on the line and burned myself out multiple times.It’s time for me to let go and live life. It feels so much better not having my self-esteem all wrapped up in how independent my income is. I’m sure soon enough the city will offer an abundance of opportunities. These things don’t need to be forced.To the contrary, I’ve discovered that opportunities only present themselves when I don’t desperately seek after them, and this move is no exception. The desire to move to a city has been in the back of my mind for years, but only once I let it go did the opportunity come my way!I couldn’t be more excited.In the meantime, I’m packing, spending time with loved ones, and of course there’s so much to write about!",

            "content": "This week I traveled 3,000 miles, the farthest away I’ve been from home, diagonally across the country from the east coast of Florida to the west coast of Washington. I am writing this post from Seattle.It is beautiful here. Everywhere I turn, the view looks like a postcard. Pictures don’t do it justice.I was expecting to come to a city and be overwhelmed with infrastructure, the lack of nature, and the accompanying impatience of its inhabitants. Luckily, my expectations have been thrown for a loop.While considering places to live, I always expected to have to compromise–to either get the populated city full of opportunity at the cost of living in a concrete trap–or get the beautiful rural area at the cost of being socially isolated… I never considered a place like Seattle existing.Trees are always present to balance out any hard edges from the buildings. This city is organic.The hills give the city layout a dynamic quality resembling a forest. I am a humble inhabitant, a rabbit, wide eyed and hopping along the forest floor. To my pleasant surprise, the strangers on the street are not predators out to hunt me down, but simply friends I haven’t met yet. The spontaneous conversations are jovial to a fault.What’s your city’s vibes?The first thing I noticed with this area is it’s infectious positive vibe. People move without rushing and are polite to a fault. This is a pleasant change from how closed off I’m used to experiencing people as.I had a profound experience while doing the most mundane activity: ordering food at a mall. The single guy running the restaurant I ordered from handed my food to me with such care, that it threw me back. I had never seen that much care put into mall food. I’m so used to people hating their jobs and being mentally absent, and seeing the quality of anything ordered suffer because of it, but here people are overflowing with pride in their work in such a way that they glow. Even if it is “just mall food.”Look at the waterConsidering that as human beings we are made up mostly of water, I have a feeling that an area’s vibes is closely linked with how water affects (or doesn’t affect) the surrounding area’s terrain.In Florida, Brevard is flat and swamp-like, so after a rain, water sits. This stagnant energy is reflected in how the area is most popular among retired individuals looking to settle down. Its residents want to sit just like the water. The negative of this stagnant energy is that for the people not looking to settle down, like young adults, it can feel like a trap, just like the water that isn’t moving.Washington, on the other hand, takes the rainwater on a journey, going down hills and waterfalls, through rivers and streams, until eventually pouring into one of its many lakes. This abundance of water supercharges the fertile soil that supports a wide variety of plants–trees, bushes, ferns, flowers, vines…The energy of this area’s water movement is again reflected in its most common resident: young adults who have moved to the area for work. People here are spontaneous and growing fast just like the abundance of plant-life surrounding them.Urban designI have developed a respect for Seattle’s city government that takes care to enhance the quality of living here in a number of ways.They have intervened a number of times to keep beautiful areas from being over-developed. Instead of more strip malls or hotels, the areas are preserved as parks.This attention to detail extends to the downtown market, where artistic entrepreneurship is literally built into the foundation.This concrete walkway has tables built in. They extend out and can be used as makeshift booths for selling goods, and many artists are set up there around the clockFamilies also benefit from this intentional design. One of the first things I noticed here is how children are so much calmer and parents are so much happier than I’m used to seeing. I had gotten so accustomed to seeing hyper children and stressed out parents, usually in the process of scolding said children, that I saw this as the way of life. But Seattle has given a lot of thought into designing solutions specifically for families, and the positive results can be seen right on their smiling faces.One of these solutions can be found at a Family Lounge by the mall bathroom. It has comfortable chairs for adults and children, some toys, a TV, as well as a few quiet rooms, which can be used for breast feeding or calming a child down.Also in the mall food court is a Family Dining Area, an enclosed section with small tables and chairs easy for children to use.The city is abundant with solutions like this.GrowthAt any given time, the skyline is populated with about a dozen cranes adding on to the city. This is a booming area full of intentional design and creative solutions. It makes me happy seeing so many resources being put to good use.My euphoria may be because I’ve only been here a week, but I can’t escape the positive energy here. Where back in Brevard I feel like I can really only add value to the small business community as a graphic or web designer, there are so many more kinds of communities that I could integrate myself into here, that in Seattle I feel like I can be anything I want…I feel bad for people who have grown up here and don’t realize how good they have it, for people who don’t realize how many opportunities are available to them, and so they keep passing them up. I am grateful for the opportunity to have come out here and am taking it for all it’s got.",

            "content": "From sending out the post I last wrote, Community Events, I got a response from a meditation teacher, and learned some hard lessons.I was making assumptions about how many people were attending events just from the number of RSVPs on Facebook or Meetup. But as the practitioner who responded to me pointed it out–this is often not the case. While looking at an event online where attendance appears to be low, in person there are a lot of regular attendees that simply don’t bother using the online system. He has popular events that sell out every month with 20-50 people, but you wouldn’t know that by looking online.I was making assumptions based in ignorance and not in experience. This is a youthful habit that has burned me before, and I want to break it. I want to stop assuming that I know more than I do, and instead be more receptive to learning. I want to stop being so judgemental and instead live more from a place of appreciation and in the moment.Coincidental CynicismIt was interesting getting his response later in a day when I was so inspired by the animator who made this video.\tIt’s funny because I was gaining so much inspiration from the animation in this video, watching it over and over again, without even paying attention to the content. Which is even funnier when you consider the reason I love this animation so much: it’s invisible. Just how I’ve strived to make the design of this site invisible so the content can shine through unhindered, this video represents that accomplishment in animation form. If you look at the video comments, they aren’t about the animation being stunning or beautiful, but about the content–about cynicism.After some reflection and letting this coincidence click, I finally realize: I have become cynical when it comes to attending local events. In just assuming that I won’t be able to connect with people here, I spare myself future disappointment by experiencing it now.I’ve been going to meetups for a long time, hosting many as well, and have had many disappointments. But these disappointments can really be traced to one thing: actions I took from a place of fear. This happened when I would go to events out of fear of nothing interesting happening again for a while, or hosted meetups out of fear that any momentum I’ve been building would have been lost. However, the results were always positive when I attended or hosted events from a joyful place free of expectations. I met many great friends and teachers in doing this.Similarly, making assumptions comes from a place of fear. Since embarking on a path of self love, I’ve opted to not make decisions from fear, and now assumption-making is included in that lot. The only rational way to make decisions is based on knowledge gained from previous experiences.To continue to act from self love sometimes means going to an event, and sometimes means staying home. It’s about living according to how I feel in the present moment.Now comes the challenge for the cynic: hope. What a fascinating thing to realize that I may have been repelling the very community and connection that I long for. I haven’t been open to receiving it, but instead have been critical, pulling out any sprouts before they have time to grow because they aren’t fully bloomed flowers I want. It’s time for me to recognize it’s potential. It’s time to patiently nurture relationships and simply let them grow. It’s time to hope that I will find community that I can connect with, or to even believe that it’s already right here and all around me.I am working to release myself of the dangerous “the grass is greener on the other side” trap of a mindset. I’m excited to be going on a two week trip to Seattle next week, as I’ve never been in a big city that long or have seen the west coast, and I’m expecting it to give me a more holistic view of wherever I end up living. Every place has positives and negatives. There is no perfect place. No matter where I live, I can connect with people, I can create, I can grow, and I can garden.***This exchange has been a great accomplishment for me. It’s been a long time since I’ve shared my work, and I’m glad it’s starting conversations, even and especially if they are conversations that are difficult for me. The internal struggle means I’m changing my beliefs and growing as a person. I’m excited to keep sharing my work and meeting people.",

            "content": "The suburban Florida county I live in is at the awkward middle between a rural community and a bustling city.Close to the beach and yet affordable, the most common resident is retired, and the most common  private profession is real estate.It’s a county that is slow and likes it that way. This culture makes the youth and innovators of the area feel restless. Most young adults and interesting leaders leave, and when the change-makers leave, this further perpetuates the status-quo that this is an area that does not change.I keep getting ideas for interesting events that have so much potential to be big successes. I see the need for social variety here—a need that is not being satisfied within myself.Collaboration is the Key to SuccessI’ve noticed that a lot of meetup organizers use the event-hosting website more like a scheduling tool for clients. I see this a lot with fitness and spiritual practitioners. They have a lot of time slots available, but most of these slots have only 0-1 attendees.As a potential attendee, I ask myself a few things:  “Do I really want to make this drive just to __ for half an hour?” I am getting tired of seeing events that I am mildly interested in, and debating back-and-forth whether it’s worth it for me to make the long drive out to attend it or not. Whether it is to meditate or do yoga, usually making more than a half hour drive just doesn’t make the trip worth it to me.  “Do I really want to attend when it will be just me and the practitioner?” What if we don’t click? Then that will be awkward and that will definitely have made the trip not worth it.I feel like my hang-ups on these questions are what is preventing wonderful local practitioners from making sustainable income with their services. But the solution is so simple.  Things would be radically different if practitioners in the same field collaborated together. If they did, events would be more interesting, last longer, would be more worth the drive out and investment for attendees. This would lead to greater present and future profits for all individuals who participate. Working together makes everybody stronger.Realizing the need for collaboration is about changing gears. You can keep doing what you’ve been doing and get more of the same, punching out more 0-1 person attended meetups, or you can collaborate to do more planning up front so together you can hit the quality out of the ballpark. What would hundreds of attendees look like? What about thousands?You are only limited by your imagination.The vision I see is for the spiritual community in particular. I’ve seen many services offered in the area for this field: yoga, meditation, sound healing, aromatherapy, tarot reading, tai chi, the list goes on…Even though I consider spirituality an important part of my life, I never attend these events. I end up debating if I should make the long drive to a meetup, but it usually isn’t worth it to me. But I would attend immediately if I saw multiple services being offered over the course of hours, or even days in the form of a retreat. I would buy tickets to that in a heartbeat!These collaborative events could be a longer with more variety, or it could be set up like a conference with a schedule where people could select from the options available for each hour. It would keep people engaged by exposing them to a variety of topics. The resulting synergy would spawn more beneficial relationships, as an excited attendee who would have never stepped foot into a practitioner’s office otherwise, now finds herself paying for one-on-one sessions. Related merchandise or tools could also be sold during this time at a discounted price. Business would skyrocket.I also see the potential for a spiritual team of practitioners to pitch the benefits of their combined services to the large corporate companies in the area. Yoga exercises could be taught specifically for people who sit at desks for long periods of time. Meditation could be taught as a way to aid decision making and more rewarding meetings. The spiritual team could even pitch the idea in order to get up-front investment to organize a longer *Professional Retreat* that the companies who sponsor it could attend.Letting GoI originally got this idea over a year ago. I shared it with a talented practitioner, but who ended up moving out of the county, and so none of this came to fruition.When this idea came back to me this morning, it frustrated me. I want to see this happen so badly, but I am unfortunately not the person to do it. I wish I was.I keep seeing the need for variety here, and from this need, I keep getting ideas for events. I have done my best to organize multiple large events, but none of them were successful, and I am finally starting to realize why.There is a difference between seeing a need, and being the person to fill that need.There is a huge difference between wanting to attend, and wanting to organize. While I want to see these kinds of spiritual events exist so badly, since I myself am not a spiritual practitioner, I am not the person to do it, so I am letting it go. I am going to pass on this idea to people in the area and hope that they run with it.I’m looking for my community.It’s interesting that I got the above idea and realized the importance of collaboration for success when I was working with my manipulative mentor—at a time when I never felt more isolated.While I have found and nurtured such rewarding friendships, I now need a larger community that I can connect to, that I can grow with. I’ve spent the better part of the last four years working with people, trying to change this area into something that it is not—doing my best to spring up an oasis in a desert because I am dying of thirst…It’s exhausting trying to force an area’s culture to change. I’m even starting to think that it’s impossible. It has to happen organically, and the trend-setters have to be happy and leading straight from the heart. You can’t make an area change in a way it doesn’t want to. You can’t change an area in a positive way all while you keep focusing on the negatives of how it’s staying the same. Letting go is the only answer.Since pursuing self-love, I have realized the importance of only making decisions from a positive place. Any decision for me to stay and continue event organizing would be a decision from a place of desperation and feeling trapped. It’s time to prove to myself that I’m not trapped by walking right out the front door.I finally realized that my two biggest problems right now, the feeling of social isolation and my lack of income, are connected. It’s impossible to get paid for adding value when you’re doing it in a vacuum. It’s all about people. A social network is the key to success just as easily as the lack of one is the key to failure.I’m finally accepting that I cannot stay in this county and keep growing. Just as the spiritual practitioners here would be much more successful if they collaborated, I need to find my own people to collaborate with.I’m now looking for the communities that I can integrate into—that I can add value to from a positive place. In alignment with my goals, I want to meet other content-creators: bloggers, YouTubers, and animators. I will likely be joining online communities.But the monumental thing is that I have finally decided: I am moving to a city.It’s overwhelming how much work needs to be done in order to move, (taking a deep breath now) but I’m excited to grow in the process. (exhale)It’s time.",

            "content": "Ever since graduating high school and my decision to not attend art school, I’ve felt like I was trapped in an artistic desert. I kept going to networking events, and even hosting my own, in hopes of meeting an artist that I could truly connect with.It wasn’t until I finally let go of my need to collaborate, and I instead focused on my own growth–on making myself a person skilled enough so that I’d become a desirable collaboration partner-that the door was finally opened for me to meet such a person.Meeting Brandon was like coming home. After meeting at a figure drawing session, we talked for hours at a cafe. It was nice connecting with somebody that was so open to my alternative viewpoints and had the same creative lens through which he viewed the world. His obsession with bears is charming.Brandon's quick take on flying bears.It’s interesting how the most valuable people in your life seem to present themselves when you least expect it.Again and again, I will feel desperate to connect with a certain kind of individual, whether it’s a professional relationship, a romantic one, or a friendship, but they never show up when I am actively looking for them. It’s only after I’ve let go do I end up meeting them, and in a coincidental and serendipitous way at that!So often we feel like we aren’t ready to meet the very people that we want to grow with. We worry about being rejected and chose the safety of isolation risk of exposure that is required for growth. We work on our craft in this isolation patiently waiting for the day when we will “be good enough.”This whole time, Brandon had been living a mere five minutes from me–in this area that I had long considered an artistic desert. We were both caught up in the trap of fear, but once we broke free, we were able to connect. It wasn’t long before Brandon and I developed a routine where we consistently worked on our drawing skills together, and we grew tremendously because of it.Here are the benefits of this kind of productive partnership:  Having a partner that will not judge mistakes, but to the contrary, will share their mistakes openly as you share yours. You alternate your role between teacher and student, learning from them and teaching them, learning faster than you could on our own.  When the focus is less on the end result, and more on the process, it doesn’t take much creative effort to turn it into an enjoyable game.  You’re more productive when together and when alone, because now you have the social pressure to keep growing in tandem with them.  Knowing what the other needs to work on, you can devise interesting challenges.  It’s more fun. The happier you are, the more productive you are. The more fun something is, the more often you are to do it. Practicing drawing regularly used to feel like work when I did it alone, but now it’s just a fun thing to do with a close friend. We sketch in-between engaging conversation. Before we know it, three hours have flown by!  There is the option to collaborate together on bigger projects.Looking at the above list, why not treat all of your relationships in this way, even and especially your closest relationships? Ask yourself if they are helping you grow or holding you back, then nurture or prune accordingly.I was teasing my developer boyfriend, Davis, because he would go to school to program in the morning, work at his programming job in the afternoon, and when he comes home, what do I, as his girlfriend, ask him to do? ...Program! Haha! We're just so passionate about improving and trying out different ideas.To me, collaborative projects feel like the utmost expression of love.Show me the pictures.What’s a post about drawing skill development without some pictures!People SketchingZooThe giraffe sketches in particular were very helpful.Click the image below to see a gallery of zoo sketches. Brandon and I spent a whole day there and it was a lot of fun. :)",

            "content": "For the list of challenges see part one.Using see-through tracing paper for back-to-back fast gesture poses was educational in terms of movement. I’m glad with this one in particular because I did well sculpting the model out of the page with the aid of surface lines and I can feel her continued movement. It’s not static.CaricatureHere’s a combination of caricature and relocation from my challenge list.Once I got the model’s basic form down, I couldn’t shake the feeling how aristocratic the pose felt. I looked up “1800s woman illustration” to get dress reference images on my phone, and worked away.Within a 20 minute session and using a permanent drawing tool, I felt this came out well, but I wanted to push it and exaggerate the expression farther… and thus the following sketch was born, and to date, it’s the one I’m most proud of.Here I am breaking anatomical rules, especially with the neck, but it was necessary for a result that was so fun to achieve. Her long neck and higher vantage point gives an aura of “I’m higher, richer, and better, than you.” She is the kind of inherited aristocrat that cares about wealth in the unhealthy way; she would be found gossiping about neighbors before she ever worked or produced anything of value.***Eight months of consistent figure drawing practice opened up a whole new world for me. Attending so regularly set the stage for me to think outside the box in order to stay engaged, and that’s what led to the creation of the challenge list in the first place.This morning I woke up barely able to move. I’ve been so excited about some new workout routines that I committed to a schedule, and just kept going with it, even though my body was demanding a break. Now I am paying the price.Similarly, my mind has been demanding a break from figure drawing. If I push through without ever taking prolonged rest, I risk damaging my mind. I have now declared this a time of rest.Rest is just as important as action. It’s in the contrast between the two that we learn. When we rest our bodies, our muscles have time to adapt from the workout, making you stronger by healing your torn muscle fibers. The same happens with our minds—a level of integration beyond our current understanding takes place. Oftentimes it’s when you direct your attention away from the problem that the solution will come to you. This is why Archimedes had his great “Eureka!” moment while taking a bath.“Obligation” and “routine” are words that should never justify not listening to your feelings on what you need to do, work or rest. I would rather train my figure drawing skills, or any skill for that matter, in high energy sprints that are unsustainable and require frequent extended breaks, than to slowly drag my feet for many miles. I’m definitely not the tortoise, but the hare. (My spirit animal is also the rabbit, so what do you know about that!)I welcome the time when I am ready to return to these challenges with refreshed perspective and motivation. In my absence, I have at least been able to work on this blog and post series. I am continuing to live by the question, “What would somebody who loved themselves do,” and I’m curious where it will lead me. Back to figure drawing, or to somewhere else entirely?I am in a sailboat. No matter how hard I try, I can’t control the winds of inspiration. I can’t make the wind appear where there is none, and I can’t make it go where I want. I am relieved that instead of getting frustrated and impatient, I now recognize wind-less times as exactly what they are: the opportunity for rest.",

            "content": "For the list of challenges see part one.This particular model has had experience modeling for Disney animators. He’s such a professional when it comes to expressive and dynamic poses. The gestures were a lot of fun.As an AnimalI thought of drawing him as an animal at the last minute, so unfortunately, I didn’t get to ask for his favorite one.Already having taken 20 minutes to draw his pose, I thought it would be fun to transfer that into the anatomy of an animal, and a giraffe seemed challenging enough. My sketchbook already had giraffe sketches from a recent sketching trip at the zoo, and they served as a handy reference.The giraffe’s expression came out this way, not because the model was particularly bored or depressed, but because that’s just the typical expression for most models in the long pose. Being able to hold the same pose for six 20 minute sessions is a challenging feat, and it unfortunately eliminates the more interesting and dynamic poses from play. Any model I’ve seen attempt a standing pose for that long has passed out—not good!Drawing a model as an animal is an exercise in animal anatomy. It pushes you to understand the anatomy enough so that you can manipulate it in an exaggerated and yet believable way. Master illustrator Heinrich Kley and his sketches of dancing alligators is the pinnacle example.When drawing animals, push to see how we all are more alike than different. Since drawing is an empathetic process, let’s extend that empathy to animals. How is your skeletal structure like a giraffe or an alligator? How would it feel moving, breathing, and living as that animal?",

            "content": "For the list of challenges see part one.AnatomyWhen I’m in a more logical mood, I’ll take the long-pose opportunity to deconstruct the model’s pose to the muscular level. I look up anatomical reference images on my phone, and recreate the model to the best of my ability. I challenge myself to see all of these fibers in a three dimensional and animated way. I ask myself:  Where do these muscle fibers connect?  How do they twist around the form—the bones and other muscles?  When this muscle contracts, what exactly does it move?With my animation goals in mind, I do my best to visualize this marionette movement in my head and internalize it.A lot of what comes out when I do this challenge is guesswork—I still have a lot of work to do in this area, but it’s not my top priority anymore. I want to be able to animate believable and interesting characters, but I’m discovering that extensive anatomical knowledge is hardly a requirement for that. I take so much enjoyment from shows like Adventure Time where the characters are simple and sometimes defy any anatomical rules at all.This realization doesn’t take away from how fascinating the human body is. We all have a skeleton of 206 bones covered in muscles—each a specific moving part that allow us to breathe, eat, touch, and more, all without us giving it a second thought. This sophisticated machine through which you interact with the world is entirely at your disposal, and the whole thing is composed of self-contained and functioning cells communicating with one-another!While you won’t see me intensifying my anatomical studies by dissecting human bodies anytime soon, you may find me on the yoga mat. I’ll be working towards more challenging poses, enhancing that beautiful connection between my mind and body in a joyful way.",

            "content": "For the list of challenges see part one.AmbidexterityDeveloping the ability to draw with both of my hands was first on my challenge list because it allows me to be even more of a Leonardo Da Vinci fan girl. Da Vinci could draw forward with one hand while writing backwards with the other—talk about talent!I dove in, taking a 20 minute figure drawing session to draw solely with my non-dominant left hand. As to be expected, drawing with my left hand is a slow and clumsy process, but what I didn’t expect was how good it felt.It felt like an orgasm for the right side of my brain—a side that had been so underused. It was like discovering an ancient tomb in my mind that had been sealed for thousands of years, and suddenly thrusting it open, making way for a massive gust of energy to sweep away all cobwebs and dust it contained. This resulting perspective was fresh and clear.Brandon did the challenge with me, and he had the same awakening experience. We agreed: It felt exhausting and awesome!Use your left hand for drawing faces.As I continued working with my left hand over the coming weeks, I realized that while my left hand was clumsy at anatomy and structure, it was phenomenal at drawing faces. It sounds strange to say: How could one hand be better at a skill than the other? Doesn’t it all come from the same brain?This realization makes sense when taking into account how the right side of your brain controls the left side of your body, and vice versa. My left hand is better at drawing faces because the right side of my brain is better at recognizing faces.I noticed that when I draw a face with my right hand, I tend to make assumptions. I cut corners making the end result look like a face, but not the model’s face.But with my left hand, I see and feel so much more of the model’s features. I don’t just see eyes, but bright eyes, tired eyes, or wise eyes. It becomes a feeling process and a richer experience.The Divided SketchbookExpanding on ambidexterity, here’s a cool idea I’ve had a lot of fun with: divide your sketchbook so you use your left hand on the left pages, and your right hand on the right pages.Left page/ left hand:Right page/ right hand:Switching back-and-forth like this is like pressing a reset button: it makes even my normal right-handed drawings come out phenomenally better.Conclusion: Use both hands.Having pursued ambidexterity for a few months, I’ve come to the conclusion that it’s best to work with the strengths of both.The left hand is good to start things out. Laying the initial curved lines—the energy of the person and their movement.The right hand is good for structure—the anatomy, and any details.Then the left hand finishes it off with a beautiful face!",

            "content": "I made this list of figure drawing challenges, because who would’ve thought that drawing naked people could get boring?The studio I’ve been attending is organzied so the nude model is in the same pose over the course of four 20 minute sessions—the long pose as it’s called.Now for me, I’m much more engaged during the quick gesture poses before the long pose. My mind just seems to work better with fast and dynamic poses that are only a minute long. I like being on my toes and it helps me channel my intuition.But since I was paying for the full class, long pose included, I wanted to curb my tenancy to leave early.I realized that if you aren’t engaged in an activity, especially a routine one like this, then there’s no point to putting in the time. I simply had to make these four 20 minute sessions more challenging. And thus, this list of challenges was born!  Ambidexterity – Use your non-dominant hand exclusively.  Anatomy – Focus on a specific muscle group and draw these muscles over the pose. Study the mechanics of this moving form.  Caricature – Exaggerate the pose or face in a way that amplifies their features.  Draw the person as a different age or gender.  Draw them as an animal, maybe their favorite animal.  Relocation – drawing them in a different environment that tells a story. Maybe even a different time period or alternate reality.  Draw a small comic strip staring them. Include different reactions and kinds of shots.  Surrealism – Draw their body, or part of their body, merging with an object, blending into the environment, or partly animal. ie: centaur, angel’s wings, disappearing into a black hole.  Draw them as a robot – see if you can draw machine parts together in a convincing way.  Flying blind – Don’t look at the paper.  Whimsical – Draw their body as a giant landscape/ playground for miniature characters running on and around them.  Illustration – Tell a story with one image. (a.)\tEditorial: capture their passions. Ask the model what topics they are passionate about, then illustrate them in a way that makes that dramatic statement. (b.)\tNarrative: capture their personality. Ask the model about their favorite memory, about the most recent dream they’ve had, or a recent memorable experience.  Graphic Design – Incorporate their features into a logo for a made-up company, into a poster for a made-up event, into a book cover for a story, or into packaging design for a made-up product. Feel free to incorporate letters, typefaces, and graphical shapes. Even ask the model for their favorite kinds of products/ events/ books in order to get a direction.  Restrictions – Put restrictions on what kinds of techniques or tools you can use. Experiment with unfamiliar mediums. If you normally work in lines, have a “no lines allowed” rule and work entirely in solid shapes. If you never work in color, do that, or if you always to, go black and white. Or restrict your color palette. See how restrictions bring the creativity out of you.As you can see, this list is less about rendering the model accurately, and more about using them as raw material for something that would be interesting, fun, and challenging to create. Think of them as clay that you are sculpting with.Co-CreationNow writing this list, I realize that this process isn’t just more engaging for me as an artist, but it also has the potential to be more engaging for other artists and the model as well. This act of creation is feeling less like a solitary act and more like a social one: co-creation.It feels like I’m becoming a performer that brings a volunteer from the audience on stage, and their input makes the show unique every time. I have to stay on my toes and improvise. Am I comedian? Well I hope as an artist, more people can enjoy my work than just me—I want people to have a good time. Am I magician? If so, I’m a bad one, because I love sharing my process.The artist has long been heralded as a solitary worker whose “creative genius” should not be questioned. I’m getting bored with this viewpoint; the resulting social isolation wears me down. I much rather play and create with lots of people enjoying and taking part in the process.",

            "content": "When embarking on my first animation project, I quickly learned that I did not possess the drawing skills required to execute at the quality I wanted.Now begins a series where I chronical my progress from eight months of consistent drawing practice—specifically drawing people, naked or in public, but typically not both. (Haha.)I’ve been drawing since a young age, so much of the technical skill comes to me as second nature. This post isn’t about the technical aspect of drawing, but the intuitive side that comes once you’ve reached a certain level of proficiency. Once you no longer have to focus all of your conscious thought on the small movements your hand and wrist are making to make marks on the page, this is what you can do to grow next.This is about getting to the place beyond conscious thought.Recent work:Before practice and mindset shifts:I attribute my dramatic improvements to reading FORCE: Dynamic Life Drawing for Animators, and this post is an elaboration on the concepts presented there.Here are the realizations that led to my growth.Drawing Life = Capturing MovementDrawing people is DIFFERENT than drawing inanimate objects. We are animated. We house life, energy, and potential energy. There is always an action or a potential action. The person is always thinking a thought and feeling an emotion. Either a person is in movement, or they are about to be—it is their thoughts that are in movement.As an artist, your job is to capture this movement.We are not static, but dynamic. We are always moving, and so are our thoughts, as are the cells that keep us alive. Everything within us is always changing and moving.These are the things I focus on capturing when drawing somebody, instead of just on rendering their form accurately as if they were only hunks of flesh. There is a huge difference between drawing life and drawing an inanimate building. Let’s embrace the life within, let’s exaggerate, discover personalities and emotions, experiment, and go wild!Show appreciation for this life with every sketch, no matter how rough.See how the body’s counteracting forces create balance.We are always counterbalancing the effects of gravity. We are on the verge of falling all the time. Our muscles have become so used to balancing us to keep us upright, that we don’t notice these subtle muscle flexes like we did when we were toddlers learning how to walk. Nonetheless, this balancing act is still happening with our every movement.Let’s focus on this balance, because understanding why the body and its muscles are responding the ways they do allows us to intuitively draw people better.“But wait,” you might be thinking, “If I want to get better at drawing people shouldn’t I study the technical terms for muscles and bones?”“Shouldn’t I get my medical license? If I’m a doctor, then I’d really know anatomy! So of course I should get a medical license so I can draw!”No.Stop.Back it up.This argument is surprisingly relevant to what we are talking about: the concept of balance.Yes, there is a time to study, this is the active energy, the Yang. But in order to achieve balance we need the passive and receptive energy of the Yin as well. You might recognize this:Most of Western society has an overemphasis on the Yang energy, the masculine, the active, and the topic of drawing is no exception. For the sake of this post, I instead focus on how to channel our underutilized Yin energy, so that we can achieve balance, just like the fumbling toddler.Here we are, learning how to walk.            Yang      Yin                  logic      emotion              think what to do      feel what to do              question      trust              structure      energy              give      receive              push      pull              muscle flexion      muscle relaxation              straight lines      curved lines      The goal is a complete and balanced whole.Awaken Your IntuitionI’m going to do my best to describe the intuitive process that seems beyond words.The best way I can describe channeling your intuition is to: Turn your brain off.If you’ve ever meditated for substantial periods of time, you might know what I’m talking about. You focus on deepening your breath and let your thoughts pass by over you like clouds. You simply be still. You release any fear and accept where you are. Once you find this quiet, timeless, and positive place, you know you are safe to learn. From here is where you channel confidence.Your intuition is powerful, but it is easily blocked. It can easily be blocked by any negative emotions, worries, and fears, oftentimes our fears about how making mistakes makes us not good enough.Our brain, or the Ego as it’s often referred to, loves to fixate on things that are wrong. We can focus on the past with sorrow, or focus on the future with anxiety. Meditation allows us to release these fears and be in the here and now where everything is okay. The present moment is where we find ourselves.We don’t beat ourselves up for not being at a better skill level, the same way we don’t yell at trees for not growing faster.In this place, we are free to trust in our own power and growth.From here, you don’t wonder what to do. Self-doubt is a passing thought that cannot get ahold of you. It can’t latch onto you because you’re too busy taking immediate definite action and learning from the results. Again and again, acting and learning.From this place, I can make marks on the page from a place of confidence and trusting myself. To amplify the confidence, I use permanent drawing tools. The picture comes out better every time when I am acting from this place of confidence, as opposed to from a place of fleeting doubt.Quiet your mind and channel this unwavering confidence within you. Trust that you already know what to do, then do it. This isn’t a thinking process, but a feeling one.EmpathizeYin requires relaxation and trust. It shows how things come out better when we don’t force a desired result, but are instead receptive to any result because it brings growth. It allows us to fail fast and to learn more from our mistakes. For more on being okay making mistakes, see Mindset Shifts for Massive Growth.The Yin of drawing people calls us to focus on the energy and emotion of the person. I’ve noticed that my work comes out better when I ask myself “What it would be like to be the thing I’m drawing?”These are the questions you ask yourself once you are able to channel your intuition:  “What would it feel like to be __?”  “What would it feel like to be… his muscle?” Is it taunt or relaxed?  “What would it feel like to be… his hair?” Is it fluffy, sleek, thin?  “What would it feel like to… make this pose?” How would my body counteract gravity? What emotion would I be feeling?Drawing life is a very empathetic process.One time during a life drawing session that I had rushed in late to, finding the model already at work, I saw something from the corner of my eye. “Smoke?” I thought to myself. Stunned, seeing a fire forming from the outlet hooked up to the heater and lamp right next to all the plush blankets by the model, I yelled with wide eyes, “Fire! Fire!” Luckily somebody was able to move and put it out. High on adrenaline, the models poses were so expressive after that, as were our drawings!Develop Mind-Body AwarenessWhat I consider a big “secret” for my figure drawing improvement, is actually the unrelated fact that I’ve been doing yoga for years. This practice has given me strong mind-body awareness that people without similar practices like yoga or dancing, don’t have.By mind-body awareness, I mean that I am aware of how I hold my body at all times. I define mind-body awareness as the practice of creating a relationship between my mind and body, always making sure that they are working together. I am aware of how I am holding myself, and how that makes me feel. I am aware of how emotions make my body feel. When I’m stressed, I can feel the tension build in my shoulders and neck. If I’m sad, I can feel my shoulders hunch over. When I am happy and confident, I notice how I stand taller. Even now as I sit at my desk and type this, I feel better when I sit up straight and have better posture.  In this way, I am always listening to my body and working with it. My mind and body have a strong feedback loop, each picking up signals from the other, and I use that to become balanced.My yoga practice has given me is a stronger sense of mind-body-awareness. When I see a model doing a complex pose, I can easily put myself in his or her shoes. I can imagine flexing and relaxing my own muscles in the same way to hold the same pose, and when I visualize doing this, the drawing comes out significantly better.I find this realization beautiful because exercise is completely unrelated to drawing, but the connection for me has been profound. I used to look at exercise as time that could have been spent working, but now I see and appreciate how it can amplify my work in ways I never could have expected.Stop lying and exaggerateOftentimes artists try to capture what is in front of them exactly, but living in a world with an abundance of camera phones, why do this?Instead of copying exactly, use what is in front of you as raw material that you can omit or change it as you please. There are no wrong answers here. Your exaggeration will have more personality, more empathy, and will be closer to the truth of the person, than an attempted realistic representation of them ever will.As you are changing up this beautiful raw material in front of you to suit your desires for your own creation, keep in mind that there are no rules. Except one: That what you are doing makes you happy.Seeking the Yin &amp; Yang balance in the drawing itselfYou can let this yin and yang metaphor carry you even further by asking yourself these questions.  Is the model in a yin or yang pose?  Where is gravity acting on the body and the body acting on gravity?  Which kind of energy does this body part have?  Would this muscle be relaxed or flexed—yin or yang?  Is this line curved or straight—yin or yang?  How can I balance these energies to create unity—a balanced silhouette?I highly recommend geting this book.Final ThoughtsI see the polarity of Yin and Yang everywhere, and drawing is no exception. Looking at drawing through this Yin lens has been beautiful. I relate with people better. I focus on how we are similar rather than how we are different. My improved empathy skills and ability to trust my intuition are what have allowed me to grow so much, without the process being painful. The whole journey has actually been a lot of fun.Before these shifts in thinking, I felt lopsided, only focusing on taking action and criticizing. It was like learning how to walk, but only using one side of my body. It was frustrating and I didn’t get very far. Gravity is brutal to the imbalanced.Now, after eight months of consistent practice and experimentation, I’ve discovered the other side of my body. I’m much more balanced and whole. Walking isn’t so difficult anymore. I like feeling the world beneath my bare feet.It’s an entirely different way of thinking—of living really—that even transcends life drawing.",

            "content": "To commemorate Inktober, a month-long artist celebration for ink during October, the local thriving comic book store, Famous Faces &amp; Funnies, hosted a challenge event. The challenge: Within 24 hours, create a 24 page comic.The event started, the room full of a dozen artists, laughing and having a good time. I joined, a bit self-conscious.Now, before going into the event, I had made the beautiful mistake of reading the gorgeous and layout rule-bending comic, Sandman: Overture… The story is about dreams, timelessness, other dimensions, and the universe ending, so… Let’s just say that as a comic-making novice, I may have set my bar a little too high.First AttemptI dove in, the first few hours working on some crazy layouts. I didn’t have a story in mind, but thought a story about the first lion tamer set in early 1800s America would be fascinating.I was pushing through and drowning in eraser shavings, meanwhile, sitting across from me, a middle-schooler and enthusiastic comic-maker was having lots of fun with her simple–yet still entertaining–story, and her cartoon style characters that lacked detail without lacking personality.Across from her, I was struggling, and eventually realized—I was going about this the wrong way. Looking at my three pitiful boards, I realized I would never finish at this pace, so I might as well scrap it, start over and have fun with it.What I learned from the first attempt:  Relax and have fun. If you’re struggling, you’re doing it wrong.  Have a goal, a direction, a story at the ready. Without this focus it’s easy to get overwhelmed by the unlimited possibilities of blank pages.  Eraser shavings are an indication of indecisiveness. If you’re spending more time erasing than drawing, then that means you need to stop and plan. Visualize before you act.Second AttemptBy the time I was ready to start over, luckily my close friend, Brandon, joined. We re-grouped, got in our pajamas and ate. We were ready to have a good time with this challenge.Its midnight, and artists were dropping like flies. The middle-schooler had long since finished her comic and gone home.Starting over, in my sketchbook I just started doodling.The story concept I’ve been the most fascinated in is social conditioning, and I remembered this concept:You see a massive fully grown elephant held captive by a flimsy rope hanging from his neck and secured to a short pole. You ask why the elephant doesn’t just break free—it would be so easy. You’re told that the elephant was first introduced to the rope and pole when he was a baby. Back then, tug and try with all of his might, he was unable to break free. Now he doesn’t try anymore.And thus, the Dejected Elephant was born.Having fond memories of elephants growing up with Dumbo, the thought of a fed up, and maybe even straight-up sarcastic circus elephant made me giggle. Brandon gave him better eyes.A handful of us remaining, we were joking, and the comic store owner let us blast Disney music over the speakers. We were all singing along while our pencils worked the night away. I found a rhythm.In addition to learning the basics of making comics, like composition, drawing characters consistently, placement, and so on, I also learned:  Create characters you like and want to explore the world with. Stories are your vehicle for doing that, and for you to grow with them.  How do your characters evolve? You can have this end point in mind as goal for the story. What events or people can they encounter that will push their evolution?  Story comes first. It’s the hardest but most important part, the foundation that all else is built on. Visual technique can only amplify what’s already there, not substitute it. Having a bad story, or none at all, is like trying to multiply something by zero. You get more nothing.Pencil worn thin and my drawing wrist was on fire. Brandon left and it was just three of us left. One of the artists gave me a well-needed hand massage and I was eternally grateful. (I still use that massage technique to this day!)The middle section was a challenge to fill, so I put in a journey between different landscapes. My eyelids demanded to shut, and it was so enticing… But fellow artist, Tony, pushed me to stay awake. He was a long-time regular to these events and always completed his comic. “Don’t you want the satisfaction of having finished it?”Okay, okay.Then he gave me the real nugget of advice: wiggle your toes, it’ll keep you awake! To this day, I use that trick to wake up in the morning.In the haze of toe wiggling and eraser-shaving-filled air (or maybe I myself had become an eraser shaving), eventually…We finished!My first attempt ate up a lot of time, so this was actually more like a 12 hour comic for me. The quality decreases as you reach the end because my drawing hand and brain were fried, but I am so glad that I completed it nonetheless. Adding the second character of an enthusiastic child added a nice dynamic, and I’m happy with the story. Here it is in its messy and beautiful entirety.Walking out, the early morning sun burned, and we hissed like any other creatures of the night. I slept for a million years.It was fun, let’s do it again next year!",

            "content": "A year ago I wanted to die.Or maybe a better way of saying it is that I was so overwhelmed with anxiety, stress, guilt, and tragic loss, that I wanted to alleviate the pain that I was being crushed under at every moment. Ending it all seemed like a potential solution. It would mean that I wouldn’t feel these horrible things anymore. All of my problems will disappear…What saved me was holding onto the reality that this also a way of abandoning my family and loved ones, whose problems were very much so real. This minute long clip from the show The Blacklist explains this better than I can, and it’s a powerful piece of acting.Suicide is a long-term and permanent solution to short-term and temporary problems.Ending it all also doesn’t just mean preventing a future of negative experiences, it means preventing a future of positive experiences as well.It comes down to a choice between committing to life or committing to death.I committed to life.2016: The Year of Post-Traumatic GrowthPost-traumatic growth: positive psychological change as the result of adversity and other challenges in order to rise to a higher level of functioning. Posttraumatic growth is not about returning to the same as it was previously experienced before a period of traumatic suffering, but rather it is about undergoing significant “life-changing” psychological shifts in thinking and relating to the world that is deeply meaningful.Talk about starting a year off on the wrong foot.I started 2016 barely able to breathe. Living at home and frequently losing sleep in a dysfunctional environment with two family members experiencing mental illness episodes, six months of working myself into the ground for a manipulative mentor, and living on a diet of frozen pizzas, my body burnt out. I had ignored my emotions and body for so long that my hormones went on strike, and I was unable to function. I was like a phone plugged in but that only ever charges to 20 percent. I could do little except sleep and lay down without getting out of breath.When you endure long periods of sustained stress, it takes a toll on your adrenals. When stress persists, this can lead to the condition I experienced, called adrenal fatigue, which can be debilitating to your daily life until you recover.  Stress is the number one killer.My body didn’t just burn out, but it burnt out at the worst possible time.In the horrifying climax of a long-term mental episode, my mom was hit by a car and was in a coma. The trauma center became our second home, meanwhile I had inherited the entire load of housework, caring for two dog and my teenage brother (who at the time, was having an episode himself), trying to be strong for my dad, and not to mention needing to address the unhealthy number of cats at home that were peeing on everything.I needed to heal so I could get everything under control, and I needed to do it fast.I needed to relax and heal my body. I needed to relax and heal my mind.I needed to relax and heal my soul.I needed to relax.Relaxing, being a concept that had been so foreign to me.Letting GoStarting 2016, I had so many breakdowns. I have never experienced that much fear, desperation, and stress in my life. You reach a certain point where your emotions take control of your physical body, and before you know it, you’re on the floor screaming and hyperventilating. When you ignore and suppress your emotions for so long, eventually they find a way out in spite of you, and when they do, trust me, it isn’t pretty.I had a choice to make. I could let this experience break me, or I could allow it to transform me.“When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves.” &ndash;Viktor E. FranklI could only survive this if I accepted one thing: What I had been doing up until this point wasn’t working.Accepting that you have been wrong is the first and hardest step. It’s time to swallow your pride, let go of past regrets, and put your fundamental beliefs under a microscope and on trial. No beliefs are safe or sacred. If a belief leads to negative experiences, then you have an obligation to cut it out. Your beliefs are the foundation you build your life on, so replace anything that isn’t solid.Holding onto a bad belief is like clinging to what you think is a life preserver, but it’s an anchor. You start drowning, but you don’t understand, so you cling tighter. Enough fighting and you eventually learn that the only thing you can do is let go.Holding Emotions HostageThe anchor I had to let go of was the way I valued logic over my emotions. I made decisions based on what made sense, especially if others validated them, regardless of how I felt about them.I desired success, and the security and acceptance that would come with it. I held my emotions hostage for this goal.My desperation would pump myself up for work that was draining and justify working with people I didn’t trust. I ended up taking out my pent up emotions on those closest to me and became a person I didn’t recognize.It was only when I stopped suppressing my emotions that all of the negativity that I had been fearing was able to flood out of me. After the chaos, I was left free to experience inner peace. I realized that if I could learn to make my happiness in the present moment my new goal, to give myself the permission to be happy, and to give myself the approval that I desperately longed for, then I would change the course of my future from one of more sacrifice and pain, to one of joy, no matter where it led.I used to set a goal and then develop destructive tunnel vision in doing anything I could, sacrificing anything I could, in order to realize that goal. I had to accept that this was not working. I was holding onto things so tightly that they were slipping through my fingers, so I opted instead to let go entirely. I worked to give myself the permission to be happy no matter outside circumstances.I started asking myself, “How am I feeling” and learning how to interpret the answers.We always make decisions based on emotions.The only reason you do anything is because you think it’ll make you feel better. There is an inescapable emotional cause of every action.You eat so you don’t feel hungry. You work so you can relax about your survival needs. Breathing feels better than holding your breath indefinitely.We always make decisions based on emotions, even when we tell ourselves otherwise. When we set priorities based on “logic” while ignoring how we feel, we are still acting based on emotion, just in this case the emotion we are acting on is fear. Building up to 2016, all of my actions were based in fear.Running away from how you feel is like trying to outrun your shadow. Your feelings are here to stay no matter how exhausted you get. Realizing this, you have two options: keep suppressing your emotions out of fear and commit to a life of misery, or recognize the value within all negative emotion. See them as little nudges showing you when changes need to be made along your journey. Ignore these little nudges, and you risk losing control to them, and you might need a counselor to help you work through them.Embrace your negative emotions because they exist to show us what needs to change.Your emotions are your life’s compass here to help you navigate.Fear Blocks FeelingThe truth is, most people are afraid to listen to their emotions.How often do we needlessly hold our emotions hostage out of fear–suppressing feelings so we can fulfill other people’s expectations for us–trying to achieve a desired result that we tell ourselves will be worth the sacrifice in the long run?In this instance, we’re still making decisions because we think they’ll make us feel better, just instead of taking actions that will directly lead to happiness, we go about it in a roundabout way. We try to achieve indirect happiness, setting out to fulfill the expectations that others have set for us, thinking that winning their approval will lead us to the happiness we seek. We act out of fear of losing their love.Where does this fear come from?As we grow up and are socially conditioned, we build habits that make us doubt our emotions and act based on what authority figures decide instead. In the school system, fear is routinely used in its reward and punishment system. We are rewarded for developing reflexive and unquestioning obedience to authority, and punished whenever we question authority or try to exercise our own decision-making power instead.  Children are never out of touch with how they feel. Adults almost always are.Young children don’t suppress or misinterpret their emotions. They regularly do what feels good in the present moment by playing with what interests them. They freely express their emotions, whether it is a welcome form of expression, like laughing, or an unwelcome form, like crying or throwing temper tantrums.Growing up, we learn to doubt our emotions as a survival mechanism. To any dependent child, the key to continued survival is adult approval, and abandonment means death. At a young age, the stakes are high to keep the adults in our lives happy.We are more or less compliant to obey authority over our emotions until adolescence. At that point we are dying to start making decisions for ourselves. To society, this is seen as teenage rebellion, but teenagers only rebel in destructive ways when not given the freedom to exercise their judgement like any other muscle.From here, teens either venture down a self-destructive path, where they value the opinions of people that their parents don’t approve of, like gang leaders, or they decide to color within the lines. There they only make decisions that they know the adults in their lives will approve of, even if it means living a lie. Either path is a death: the first being a material one, the second being a spiritual one.  We get conditioned to value the opinion of others over how we feel.Deeper than that, we get conditioned into believing that making the authority figures in our life happy is the key to our happiness.Either way, growing up without regular opportunities to interpret your emotions and to use this compass to guide your life, and the compass gets rusty.In order for you to see the true value of your emotions, you need to use them to make decisions.  The key to an amazing life is a strong connection to your emotions. This only comes with practice and it can atrophy like any muscle: You use it, or lose it!You can only meet your emotions with love if you release the fear blocking its path, and all fears, no matter how complex, are rooted in the fear of losing love.The Foreign Concept of Self-LoveIf all fears are rooted in fear of losing love, then how can you release all fear and open a strong dialog with your emotions once and for all?This is where the beautiful concept of self-love comes in.I first came across the concept of self-love while I was wallowing in self-hate, hating myself for a number of reasons, most of all, impatience with my professional growth. Like light and dark, one cannot exist without the other, and self-love cannot exist without self-hate.Meeting YourselfIn order to start a dialog with your emotions, you’re going to need to want to have a good relationship with yourself in the first place.The relationship you have with yourself is the most important relationship of your life. It becomes the foundation for everything else.It might sound strange, but how is your relationship with yourself? Would you call it healthy, supportive, and nurturing… or unhealthy, embedded with criticisms, neglect, and misunderstandings? When you look in the mirror, what thoughts do you think about yourself?Reflect on where you currently stand with yourself.Why is self-love so hard?When your desire and ability to understand your emotions becomes eroded, as does your ability to love yourself. It’s hard to give yourself what you want when you truly don’t know what that is.FirstlySelf-love is difficult, firstly because we grow up learning how to love others unconditionally, while we only learn to love ourselves conditionally. While we learn to love others in spite of temporary mistakes, we learn that love is only given to us if we meet certain requirements.“I love you, but only when you get good grades.”“I love you, but only if you lost weight.”“I love you, but only [fill in the blank].”These statements get embedded in our psyche, and become the weapons that we beat ourselves up with.The concept of self-love is what brings attention to the destructive voice that may have taken residence in your head. This voice may call you stupid, fat, lazy, etc. In working to love yourself, you ask yourself: Would I say half the statements I say to myself to a friend?SecondlySelf-love is difficult because we learn that to love yourself is selfish and will lead to you being a bad person. Fearful of being considered selfish and unworthy of love, we instead do what we learn is good, which is to be selfless, and that means putting the happiness of others above our own.This is a destructive choice because it’s not possible to act from a place of either pure selflessness or pure selfishness. One is destructive to others, while the other is destructive to self. You need a balance of both giving and getting in order to live prosperously.Consider the kinds of people who are stubborn about doing the work they are passionate about. These kinds of people end up doing better work because of their passion, but they had to be selfish in order to stick with and share their passion with the world. In the end, the world is grateful for their authenticity.Think of the word selfless.Self-less.Without self.The self is the very thing you should never be without.Your self is the very thing that you should never sacrifice.How you can make peace with these conflicting beliefs is to understand that if you try giving to others without first giving to yourself, you will have nothing to give. You need to fill up your own cup first, but once you do, soon the water spills over, meaning that now you have much more available for effortlessly giving.ThirdlyWe lose touch with our emotions for fear of becoming irrational. This fear is unfounded, because emotions and logic don’t have to be at odds with each other, but can instead be used to verify each other. You can, and should, make decisions that satisfy both your head and your heart. Listening to your emotions isn’t irrational, it’s a rational way of prioritizing your happiness first.People who are happy prioritize how they feel. This makes them less likely to burn themselves out, and leads them to producing much better work. Contrary to what fear-based ideologies condition us to believe, the more that people place top priority on their individual happiness, the better it is for everybody in the long run.For more in depth work with self-love, I highly recommend this video and the book Shadows Before Dawn.Tuning into Your SelfHow are you feeling?When you ask yourself this, do you get a clear answer?When I started the journey of self-love and listening to my emotions, I was surprised at how difficult it was… Communicating with my heart felt like trying to interpret weak radio signals in another language. In the beginning it was almost impossible, but with persistence and time, I started getting better at understanding what my heart was telling me.Feelings = ThoughtsAll feelings come from thoughts. Positive thoughts lead to positive emotions, negative thoughts lead to negative emotions. When you have a negative emotion, but aren’t sure why, patiently follow it to its root of a negative thought. Like any weed, these need to be pulled out.You can change your emotions by changing your thoughts.If you struggle with reoccurring negative thoughts, then that is caused by a belief. Beliefs are just thoughts that have become so automatic that you are barely conscious of them anymore. With conscious effort and patience, you can change negative and limiting beliefs, which I encourage you to do. You have an obligation to yourself to change any beliefs you have that don’t serve you.  Stress may be the number one killer, but what is stress but negative emotion? What is negative emotion but an outspoken negative thought within us that we haven’t acknowledged?The Year-Long ExperimentUnderstanding the importance of emotions and self-love is one thing. Applying it, however…Being at my breaking point in 2016, I didn’t have anything to lose, so when I stumbled upon the 365 Days of Self-Love experiment in Shadows Before Dawn, I latched onto it for dear life.The challenge is simple. For 365 days, live your life by this question:  “What would somebody who loved themselves do?”For an entire year, I let the answers to this question be the guiding factor in my life, no matter how significant of a crossroads I was at. I asked it when making decisions like what to eat, but also bigger decisions, like where to direct my productive focus.The answers to this question usually come easily. It’s putting the answers into action that is the challenging part. It meant prioritizing my happiness in the present moment over all else in my life, even the expectations of others. If you do the challenge yourself, it might mean changing the dynamics of your relationships, or letting go of some relationships entirely. It certainly did for me.ResultsWhen I started this challenge, I had no idea what I was getting into to. I thought for sure that the whole year would’ve ended up being a waste of time where I just did fun things without learning or getting any work done. After all, how can you expect to get any work done without the risk of a whip cracking on your back?To my pleasant surprise, after having practiced self-love for a year, I can say it was the best decision I have ever made, and I am never going back.Living by this question has brought me such tremendous happiness and growth that it has become impossible for me to live any other way. Sometimes I slip up and will fall back into old thought habits that will make me feel negative, but eventually, I always relearn these lessons and come back to living by “What would somebody who loved themselves do” with joy.I can conclude the year saying that the results were incredible. Despite all of the trauma I’ve been through, this was still an amazing year for me during which I transformed much of how I live and how I see the world.I stabilized what used to be an unhealthy household. I helped my brother learn how to manage his mental illness and taught him life skills. I went from living off of processed food to going vegan with a diet mostly of fresh produce. I read 15 books. I met amazing people that I’m honored to call my friends and collaboration partners. I dramatically changed my spiritual and political beliefs.I got out of my shell and took acting classes, dramatically improved my ability to draw the human form–the lessons from which I can apply to rapid growth for any skill, started playing the ukulele, and made progress in learning the disciplines of both video and web animation.There are many lessons from the year that I will share in upcoming posts.In summary, I have learned:  Your emotions are the compass guiding your life.  Positive emotions are your indication that you are doing the right things.  Negative emotions are your indication that you need to change something, whether that means changing the outside environment by taking action, or changing your inner environment by changing your thoughts.These lessons are so ridiculously simple that I’m surprised I ever got conditioned to live otherwise.I dare youBe kind to yourself. Explore the concept of self-love, and start living by the question, “What would somebody who loves themselves do?”What do you have to lose?",

            "content": "Taking two months to complete, building and designing this website has been an educational and rewarding process. Here’s how I got it done.Similarly, read New Beacon to see my purpose with blogging.Here are the reasons that made getting this website up and running more urgent:  I’m bursting at the seams with content that needs to be shared. I compulsively write blog posts that average 2,000 words in length, and come up with supporting illustrations and graphic concepts. I have a backlog of over thirty new and partially fleshed out posts… I wish I was exaggerating!  I want to focus on completing the biggest project I’ve undertaken to date, the Lion Poem Animation, but I have no place to chronical my works-in-progress and learning, let alone a place to share the finished project (except the brevity of YouTube).  Accountability: I want to finish what I start. Sharing goals publically adds some needed social pressure.  Experiments: I don’t want to only leave a string of finished projects in my wake, but also behind-the-scenes and lessons learned from making them. I change things up frequently, lately oscillating between researching, writing, drawing, web development, and playing the ukulele, and I’ve been letting this playful and experimental nature lead my work. The results are rarely uninteresting.Now, let’s get into the logistics, the What and How of making the site.Why build my own, and why not something simpler?… like Squarespace? Tumblr? Weebly? Wix?There are many simple solutions out there that are wonderful. I’ve tried most of the popular ones, always reaching the same conclusion:I want more control than these solutions provide.Having worked on websites for a few years, I never had the satisfaction of building a decent and professional-looking website from scratch. I’ve always modified existing templates, even to the point of barely resembling what the author had originally intended. This of course is not good practice… It makes for bloated and sloppy work, and is a monster to maintain.Part of this website is redemption. I’ve called myself, and even made money as, a web designer for a few years, but I never felt confident in the skill. My design sense greatly surpasses my ability to execute in code. It was time to tackle the elephant in the room that I had been running away from for so long: programming!Programming Beyond the WebsiteThe possibilities will blow your mind.Months before I decided on the website project, I became inspired by the form on online content called microsites. Microsites are just what the name implies, smaller websites created for a single laser-focused goal.As an example, take a second to view the beautiful experience that has rocked my world: The Boat. It details the story of a mother and son on a dangerous journey.The story is based on a book, and if the project was led by more traditional minds, then the only other format it likely would have been told in is as a graphic novel.But what happens when you take those illustrations, put them on a web page, and make them dynamically respond to user input? On the website, the story progresses as you scroll, images fade in or out, the music gets more dramatic or calm, you trigger sound effects The effect is that the story is exponentially more engaging.The possibilities that arise when I consider adding user interactivity to my content tickles me pink.Now the blog becomes more than a place to store written text, but a dynamic home base from which to branch off with microsites I create. It becomes a place to share experiments from the world of web development and animation.Isn’t that exciting?The case for control was further strengthened. Naturally, the more control you want, the more complex the solution is. I’ve come to terms with this and finally started teaching myself programming.Self-Education for Web DevelopersTo get my feet wet, I first embarked on Udacity’s Front-End Web Developer curriculum. The courses are free to take, though you can pay if you want a credential.In a couple months, I completed the following:  JavaScript Basics  Intro to jQuery  HTML5 CanvasThere still is much left to learn in the program, but this was a good stopping point in order to code a website.Also tremendously helpful has been the DevTips YouTube channel. I have so much respect for the creator, Travis Neilson. His videos have great energy and balance information and humor well. It’s also inspiring how each of his “blog posts” are actually beautiful standalone webpage designs in it of themselves.Why I dumped WordPress for JekyllI have a decent amount of experience with WordPress, and it’s what I used for my Cheating College website. It is the most used CMS, Content Management System, for blogging, so you know it’s good!I didn’t even consider using anything different until I came across DevTips responsive website tutorial series and was introduced to the wonders of the static site generator Jekyll.Here’s how Jekyll broke WordPress’ heart:  Making the switch means I don’t have pay for hosting. This reason was big! Website hosting is about $100/year, but with Jekyll, hosting is free through GitHub Pages. Score!  Through GitHub you also have version control: If a change you make accidentally breaks the site, you can easily revert to the version before the change.  Don’t have to deal with a database. Since this is just a personal site, not a forum or online store where people can sign in, having a database just to contain my content seems unnecessary.  Don’t have to defend said database against malacious software. Even with my modest Cheating College blog, this consumed an unnecessary amount of time.  WordPress is built on PHP. Having experience working with it, I must say, PHP is not a fun language to work in. On the other hand, Jekyll templating is done with Liquid, a language that is actually build for templating; how useful!  A great amount of control is available through both WordPress and Jekyll, but I find Jekyll easier to learn and easier to make wide-sweeping changes with. Jekyll is more suited for small-scale use, while WordPress being more suited for larger and more established websites.When I accumulate more content, I foresee myself graduating to WordPress in the future, but currently I want to keep things tiny, lean, and manageable. Jekyll is a great and agile way to experiment with development.Now to get into the specific goals of the site.The Best Design is InvisibleAmid all the flashy color choices, display fonts, and gradients, I’m going to go on a limb here and say that the best design is invisible. It’s that uninterrupted flow of user action: When you sign up on a website and nothing out of the ordinary happens. Nothing good or bad really stood out. You went in, accomplished what you wanted to, and then went about your business.Back when I was looking to start as an illustrator, I would go about setting up a website, but then get paralyzed in the quest for the perfect header and banner design. Which illustration should I use? What colors represent me?Years ago my guiding thoughts were about my “brand” and how to stand out and dazzle the viewer… The resulting indecisiveness often led to no website being made at all.This time my goal was refreshingly the opposite: make the design invisible. Allow it to fade into the background so my content can take center stage. My goal was to minimize distractions in order to allow the content to speak for itself.Invisibility as a design goal is reflected in this final product. No banner image, just my name. Even when I got stuck on a main color to use, I cut the nonsense and went with a palette of grays.Is having a red website because I'm a redhead really that clever?Keeping the colors of the website black, white, and grays might sound boring, but it fits perfectly because even when drawing, I predominantly work in black and white. Keeping the website consistent with that feels right. Also, when I would make images for Cheating College, I felt restricted to the orange color scheme I had chosen for the brand. But now with a black and white canvas that guarantees no clashing, I can share work that has any color palette under the sun.Having liberated myself to allow what’s unimportant be invisible, I was able to devote more time to the readability of the site. Most of my time designing was actually spent picking the right fonts, making sure paragraphs read well, along with headers, lists, and blockquotes. My top priority was making reading the content a comfortable experience.I expanded on my knowledge of typography by reading this beautiful guide: Butterick’s Practical Typography.I even added a custom side note element for use when I venture down a bit of a tangent while writing a post, which happens often![[ Insert unrelated tangent here. ]] Side notes are so useful!Once the blog post read well, most of the design work was already done.Unexpected CollaborationWe make better together.While working on this project, my boyfriend, Davis, has been supportive. In the pursuit of his own passions, he’s been teaching himself programming for over a year, and has even started teaching me as well.Before he brought it up, I hadn’t even considered the possibility  of him working with me on the website.Now I have a caveat, I believe when doing projects it’s important to intend to complete them, even if you have to do it 100% alone. It’s crucial not to get hung up on the contributions of others, something that is so out of your control and subject to change.But I also must say, a part of me, my ego, was excited about being able to say, “I made this entire site by myself!” I had to step back and realize that Davis’ contribution was a wonderful opportunity to complete the project faster than I would working on it alone, and if I wanted that, then I had to let go of some control. I had to give Davis the breathing room to use his strength to make the project better.I am so glad I did, because we were able to get the bunk of the project done in just a month! He focuses on development, I focus on design, and that way we make a wonderful team. Thanks to the work I’ve done in learning programming, I can understand his contribution and appreciate it more.Tools LineupWhy reinvent the wheel? Here are some other tools used to get this bad boy up and running:  Jekyll - static site generator  Brackets - my beautiful and minimal code editor of choice. Open source, and ideal for web dev.  Microsoft Visual Studio Code - Davis’ code editor of choice.  Trello - project management  MailChimp - newsletter signup. Free up to 2,000 subscribers.  Lunr.js - search functionalityVersion 2: What to expectFor simplicity’s sake, this version is text-based and mostly barren of my artistic personality. This website is something that I will grow with, and once I have more content and projects completed, I’ll start working on a more picture-based design to display the kind of work I do.Things to look forward to:  custom projects section  custom home page  Cheating College posts archiveFor an update further in the future, I could add the functionality so readers could specify the topics they want to subscribe to: Maybe you’re only interested in my thoughts on creativity and productivity, but not about relationships. I could segment the subscriber list based on interests.I also foresee myself creating separate email opt-ins for specific project updates.Then comes of the issue of type of content. The example: If somebody isn’t as interested in my writing as they are in my animations. Categorizing by type seems like a less desirable way than categorizing by interest. To most people, content is content, no matter the form.However, I am playing with the idea of being able to filter by type. I want to add that functionality to the search bar, and am considering adding links to the navigation bar as well. Though, I am keeping in mind: I want to prevent this site from becoming a static portfolio page for old work so that it can remain a value-adding blog.There are lots of things to consider for future updates, but for now, let’s get cozy with what we have. :)I’m excited to pause website development and focus on the reason I did all that work: So I can start getting all of my content out of my head and into yours!",

            "category": "",
            "content": "In examining skill development, I decided to go a step beyond the generic ‘slow and steady wins the race’ advice. Instead, I decided to dive into how mindset shifts can lead to massive gains quickly. I didn’t just want to be the tortoise, but the hare as well.The following are lessons I’ve gained from experimenting with mindset shifts in respect to  the skill I’ve been developing in my life, drawing people, but these insights can be applied to any skill you’re developing.Choose: Make mistakes or Give upThe past seven months, I’ve been rigorously studying how to draw human anatomy: how to capture a person’s personality and expression while they are going about their business in the public. I’ve been attending weekly three-hour nude figure drawing classes, and have been people sketching in public places.Here’s some recent work:  And here’s some from right before I started regular practice:So much of the challenge with skill acquisition is overcoming the fear of failure enough to let yourself make the mistakes required to learn anything.I’ve noticed this my whole life when people would approach me while I was drawing, explaining how they can’t draw. I’d point to their perfectly functioning hands, and ask, Why not?It’s not that people can’t draw — that they truly are incapable of making marks on a page — it’s that they won’t. They’re too scared.Scared of messing up, of making bad art, and of their self-worth being defined by that bad art. This mindset says, “Steve makes worthless art, which means he is a worthless person. He should just give up.”It goes without saying, these fears are not true. Though it isn’t rational, it is the kind of traumatizing event people foresee happening when they consider expressing themselves — so they jump ahead to end result they already predict: they give up.Unfortunately, in an attempt to avoid pain, they end up causing more of it. The pain of embarrassment is nothing compared to the pain of regret.Do yourself a favor right now and embarrass yourself.Do something silly and strange in public. Hug a tree at a park. Walk through the supermarket backwards. Dance in a coffee shop when your favorite song comes on. Have fun!Come back when you’ve learned that you can embarrass yourself all you want, your world won’t end. To the contrary, you will become stronger.Done?Okay, good.Have it be known that I when I was at the mall with my friends as a preteen, and one of the quarter machines gave us a fake mustache that went perfectly with my red hair, I slapped it on and wore it all throughout the mall.And you know the hilarious thing? Nobody even said anything. People would notice but then would avoid eye contact.I have yet to die of the resulting embarrassment.Moving on.You are not defined by your embarrassing moments, and if you embark on an embarrassment-free life, then you are shooting all of your potential in the foot.Similarly, you are defined by your mistakes, but not in the bad way you would expect: You are the lessons you have learned when your actions didn’t yield the results you wanted.That’s all a mistake is. See, it not so scary.You can’t have learning without mistakes.Developing mastery of a skill demands mistakes as payment.Mastery has less to do with time invested, like the famous 10,000 hours being proclaimed today, or even daily practice routines.Mastery is the cumulative result of how many mistakes you have made and resulting lessons that you have internalized. It is about internalizing mistake, after mistake, until you can navigate from beginning to end doing a cleaner run each time.It’s like flying a plane from point A to B, and making many micro-adjustments along the way. Getting better each time, you learn what to do by proxy of elimination: by learning what not to do.Soon the ratio of making mistakes to producing results shifts, and people start noticing your work.Never stop making mistakes.In any field, a master’s work looks like magic to those with less skilled eyes, but a master looks at it always seeing what he needs to improve on.Leonardo Da Vinci invested so much more time into studying and depicting life than his fellow Renaissance artists. Many of them thought he was a joke because he took so long to finish any single piece, if he finished it at all.Da Vinci studied plants, dissected human bodies, and learned how life works, from the inside out. In his work he depicted life so well, in such extreme detail, that his work has always induced visceral reactions in people. Owners of his paintings would be caught kissing the women he so vividly depicted on canvas, and museum security guards have often been fired when they would start developing unhealthy relationships with his paintings.His work remains the most vandalized of any other painter of the time period.All of that, but he still said this:I have offended God and mankind because my work didn't reach the quality it should have. - Leonardo Da VinciOh Leo, don’t be so hard on yourself!He still saw the mistakes in his paintings, even his masterpieces, even The Last Supper, even the Mona Lisa.Where we see a masterwork, the master sees what he needs to improve on. Unless you want to stagnate, accept that no matter how good you get, you will always be a little unsatisfied. You will always be noticing new mistakes you have made, even if those mistakes become harder to notice by the untrained eye.Vision always surpasses execution, and there is always more to learn. This is a good thing, because without learning, there is no happiness. With so much to learn, happiness is in abundant supply.You learn more when you feel good about making mistakes.If you can release your fear of failure and let yourself learn from mistake after mistake, then you can hit the turbo-speed on your learning. You could even travel at warp-speed, leaping ahead and accomplishing years of lessons in the fraction of the time.I’ve been drawing consistently, though rarely daily, for as long as I can remember. Still, I would often fall into emotional traps that stifle growth: comparing myself to others with more experience, feeling inadequate, feeling pressured to make a living with drawing, etc.You learn best in a flow state, or when you are so totally immersed in the task at hand that hours pass by unnoticed. This state is delicate and requires peace of mind.Negative thoughts easily override flow, and if you ignore any of these feelings, and try to learn in spite of them, you will only bring frustration.Doing creative work in the company of negative emotions is like putting a dark blanket on a beautiful stained glass window. Some colored light might get through, but it’s only when you take the blanket off that the light can flow through unhindered and you can admire its beauty.For the sake of saving time and preventing unnecessary suffering, deal with any unresolved negative emotions before diving into work. Make this is a daily practice of mindfulness.Drawing is a mental game.One of the reasons I love drawing is that it concretely shows me my state-of-mind in the given moment; it’s an instant feedback loop on my mood.When I feel good, confident, and am interested in what I am drawing, I can easily fall into a flow where making good drawings is effortless.However, the second a negative thought slips in, a fear, my hand will slip. What used to be a woman’s gorgeous face now has a Hitler-stache. Whoops, how did that get there?Usually I can redirect my thoughts and get back into the flow. If not, the act of creating feels less like fun, and more like a sacrifice, and the entire thing derails.Here’s a list of mindset shifts I’ve applied that have virtually eliminated that kind of negative emotion downward spiral and have kept me in consistent and longer flow states:  Seeing mistakes as learning instead of something to feel embarrassed or ashamed about.  Developing a strong sense of self-worth that isn’t dependent on the quality of my work that day.  Emphasizing quantity over quality so I can output more mistakes and learn from them faster.  Having an intention, a specific thing to learn, for each piece. Focusing less on how it looks and more on what I learned while making it.Drawing only with permanent pen.…or as I call it, diving in ink-first!I quickly internalized the above shifts when I put my pencils away to collect dust, and started only drawing in pen.Drawing in pen gives permanence to the mistakes I make, meaning that they will always be there for me to learn from.Rather than erasing, drawing over, erasing and drawing over, which can eliminate the mistake from memory, a mistake in pen is here to stay. I even make notes next to it, and try again. I can refer back to it. I can build on top of it.It’s not always pretty, but that’s not the point; learning is.Making a successful drawing in pen requires trust. A good output only happens when I trust myself to be okay with any mistakes that come up.Interestingly enough, the more I am okay with making mistakes, the less I actually make.How can you give permanence to the mistakes you make in your work?How can you give yourself no other alternative than to let go and trust?Art as Athletic PerformanceLately when I sit to sketch, I’ve been seeing myself less as an emotional artist, and more as a dedicated athlete.Athletes visualize the end result. They see themselves crossing the finish line and imagine what it feels like to win. They have a clear goal in mind, yet make mistakes all the time. When they fall, they get back up. They learn how to adjust their muscles, diet, and sleep in order to do amazing things.I’ve started viewing my art less like a physical embodiment of my self-worth, and more like how an athlete views his most recent performance: It’s a score to be improved upon next time.The score is the summation of how he has challenged himself in training, incrementally, slowly building difficulty, endurance, patience, flexibility…In this performance that is making art, I get to appreciate all the work I’ve invested to reach this point, all the micro-adjustments I’ve learned to make from countless mistakes. I give myself the opportunity to practice appreciation.In this mindset, I don’t worry about whether or not people will like the end product. Making my art is a performance, the needed release of accumulated study, trial, and effort. From it I learn where to go next. It is a journey that is an entirely internal process with internal gratification.Don’t let impatience kill your growth.Along the way to mastery, it can be easy to become impatient, to desire an output that we aren’t capable of producing yet.Impatient, we become frustrated with our mistakes, and so stop experimenting. We unconsciously do what feels safe, which is repeating what we know. We make the same kind of work, saying the same thing, the same way, over and over again.Unchecked, this can lead to stagnation, unhappiness, and a lot of wasted potential. The creative process that fuels our learning and happiness requires continual risk-taking.Leonardo Da Vinci understood the dangers of impatience. He even had a motto to combat it: ostinato rigore, which translates to stubborn rigor or tenacious application.His motto means to cultivate pleasure in pain, like an athlete: To learn to enjoy the rigorous practice where you push past your limits and go further than you ever have before…Go forth, tenanciously apply yourself, and don’t hold back.",

            "content": "For seventeen months outstretched over 2014 and 2015, I wrote for my blog that I called Cheating College. I gave it this slogan: lifelong learning without lifelong debt.Cheating College was a way for me to chronical my alternative education pursuits and to dispel advice I learned while on my journey. It was also a great way for me to build the habit of writing regularly and creating content with the intent to be read by a specific audience.It empowered me to figure things out for people, to study problems and present solutions, and to make myself of value to others.During that time, I wrote over 30 articles, totaling over 54,000 words, and made over thirty custom graphics/ illustrations.I shut the blog down when I hit a number of brick walls in my career and family lives (which I will share once the emotions aren’t so raw…) When I shut down the blog, at first it felt like I had removed a part of myself from existence, the beacon that had been letting the world know “I am here, and this is what I do” had been extinguished…In the uncomfortable darkness, I eventually learned more about myself and how I want to start again: better, stronger, wiser.Here’s a list of what I learned from the entire blogging experience, and how I will do things differently this time around.1. IntentionI had started Cheating College with the intention to make it profitable. When I first started publishing posts, I was convinced I’d be making money within six months, and that before I knew it, I would be kicking back, reaping the rewards… Ha!Profitability is not my goal this time. This time, there is no endgame.My goal with this new blog is simply to share my thoughts, because…2. I may have stopped blogging, but I’ve never stopped writing.I’m always writing, journaling, researching: asking questions and drawing conclusions.I’ve amassed quite a bit of work, which I’m starting to feel like a guilty hoarder for keeping it all to myself. Who am I not to share what others could benefit from? Moreover, who am I not to share when the potential feedback, counter-arguments, and opportunities that could result stand to make me a better person?I can’t stop writing if I tried, so I might as well start sharing!3. Any topic is fair game.Cheating College was a great forum for me to teach myself how to create content that addressed specific concerns and desires for a niche audience. It taught me how to write, but always with a clear purpose guiding my words.This time I don’t feel the need for such a restrictive compass. I’m not pigeon-holing myself to talk about only education and career topics, but instead opening myself up to dive into any topic I feel the need to. This is really liberating… like—standing on the edge of a boat, arms wide open, yelling “I’m king of the world!” kind of liberating…This opens the floodgates for me to share about something so vital to my existence that I wasn’t able to before: my art. My obsession with visual communication, and my journey in its skill acquisition.Which brings me to…4. Investing more time in making higher quality content.Blogging the first time around, I let the rules of social media dictate what content I made. I consistently aimed for one blog post a week, and always felt terrible when my output fell short. I often aimed to post the recommended frequency on Facebook, Twitter, etc…This typically resulted in a post 2,000 words long, with a simple custom illustration or two.If I never hit the brakes on that production pipeline, I never would’ve realized my newfound desire to… animate my ideas.If a picture is worth a thousand words, what about MOVING pictures? What about 24 pictures per second? ;)Now free from the “must post weekly mindset,” I’m building on my foundation of visual communication. I have a pipeline of personal projects and animations that will each take months, years even, to see to completion. And here is where I’ll share them.5. Laser-focusA lot of my old posts were actually more like exercises in “let’s find out ALL the things I can say about x.” Most of the articles actually ended up being three-posts-in-one.This happens to me a lot, even in other mediums, like speech-writing: I embark on one idea, yet the content for three spurt out like the birth of the mythical multi-headed Hydra.This is a common problem, the problem of trying to say too much at once, which inevitably leads to nothing being said at all.No more three-for-ones resulting in massively long posts that scare away even the most dedicated reader: this time I will be more liberal with laying down the axe. Each post will have a clear purpose from beginning to end, one head and one tail—these are messages, not conjoined siblings!ConclusionWho I am today has so much to do with the work I did in my first attempt at blogging. Cheating College may be referred to in past tense (I’ll be putting up its posts in an archive), but I’m thrilled that my devotion to writing and sharing is not.I’m declaring this my new beacon.",
